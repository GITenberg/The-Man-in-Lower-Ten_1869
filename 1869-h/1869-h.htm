    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. I GO TO PITTSBURG
    </h2>
    <p>
      McKnight is gradually taking over the criminal end of the business. I
      never liked it, and since the strange case of the man in lower ten, I have
      been a bit squeamish. Given a case like that, where you can build up a
      network of clues that absolutely incriminate three entirely different
      people, only one of whom can be guilty, and your faith in circumstantial
      evidence dies of overcrowding. I never see a shivering, white-faced wretch
      in the prisoners' dock that I do not hark back with shuddering horror to
      the strange events on the Pullman car Ontario, between Washington and
      Pittsburg, on the night of September ninth, last.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight could tell the story a great deal better than I, although he can
      not spell three consecutive words correctly. But, while he has imagination
      and humor, he is lazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't happen to me, anyhow,&rdquo; he protested, when I put it up to him.
      &ldquo;And nobody cares for second-hand thrills. Besides, you want the
      unvarnished and ungarnished truth, and I'm no hand for that. I'm a
      lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So am I, although there have been times when my assumption in that
      particular has been disputed. I am unmarried, and just old enough to dance
      with the grown-up little sisters of the girls I used to know. I am fond of
      outdoors, prefer horses to the aforesaid grown-up little sisters, am
      without sentiment (am crossed out and was substituted.-Ed.) and completely
      ruled and frequently routed by my housekeeper, an elderly widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, of all the men of my acquaintance, I was probably the most
      prosaic, the least adventurous, the one man in a hundred who would be
      likely to go without a deviation from the normal through the orderly
      procession of the seasons, summer suits to winter flannels, golf to
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was a queer freak of the demons of chance to perch on my
      unsusceptible thirty-year-old chest, tie me up with a crime, ticket me
      with a love affair, and start me on that sensational and not always
      respectable journey that ended so surprisingly less than three weeks later
      in the firm's private office. It had been the most remarkable period of my
      life. I would neither give it up nor live it again under any inducement,
      and yet all that I lost was some twenty yards off my drive!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really McKnight's turn to make the next journey. I had a tournament
      at Chevy Chase for Saturday, and a short yacht cruise planned for Sunday,
      and when a man has been grinding at statute law for a week, he needs
      relaxation. But McKnight begged off. It was not the first time he had
      shirked that summer in order to run down to Richmond, and I was surly
      about it. But this time he had a new excuse. &ldquo;I wouldn't be able to look
      after the business if I did go,&rdquo; he said. He has a sort of wide-eyed
      frankness that makes one ashamed to doubt him. &ldquo;I'm always car sick
      crossing the mountains. It's a fact, Lollie. See-sawing over the peaks
      does it. Why, crossing the Alleghany Mountains has the Gulf Stream to
      Bermuda beaten to a frazzle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I gave him up finally and went home to pack. He came later in the
      evening with his machine, the Cannonball, to take me to the station, and
      he brought the forged notes in the Bronson case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard them with your life,&rdquo; he warned me. &ldquo;They are more precious than
      honor. Sew them in your chest protector, or wherever people keep
      valuables. I never keep any. I'll not be happy until I see Gentleman Andy
      doing the lockstep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on my clean collars, found my cigarettes and struck a match on
      the mahogany bed post with one movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the Pirate?&rdquo; he demanded. The Pirate is my housekeeper, Mrs.
      Klopton, a very worthy woman, so labeled&mdash;and libeled&mdash;because
      of a ferocious pair of eyes and what McKnight called a bucaneering nose. I
      quietly closed the door into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your voice down, Richey,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She is looking for the evening
      paper to see if it is going to rain. She has my raincoat and an umbrella
      waiting in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The collars being damaged beyond repair, he left them and went to the
      window. He stood there for some time, staring at the blackness that
      represented the wall of the house next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's raining now,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder, and closed the window and
      the shutters. Something in his voice made me glance up, but he was
      watching me, his hands idly in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who lives next door?&rdquo; he inquired in a perfunctory tone, after a pause. I
      was packing my razor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House is empty,&rdquo; I returned absently. &ldquo;If the landlord would put it in
      some sort of shape&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you put those notes in your pocket?&rdquo; he broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I was impatient. &ldquo;Along with my certificates of registration,
      baptism and vaccination. Whoever wants them will have to steal my coat to
      get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I would move them, if I were you. Somebody in the next house was
      confoundedly anxious to see where you put them. Somebody right at that
      window opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scoffed at the idea, but nevertheless I moved the papers, putting them
      in my traveling-bag, well down at the bottom. McKnight watched me
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a hunch that you are going to have trouble,&rdquo; he said, as I locked
      the alligator bag. &ldquo;Darned if I like starting anything important on
      Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a congenital dislike to start anything on any old day,&rdquo; I
      retorted, still sore from my lost Saturday. &ldquo;And if you knew the owner of
      that house as I do you would know that if there was any one at that window
      he is paying rent for the privilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton rapped at the door and spoke discreetly from the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. McKnight bring the evening paper?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, but I didn't, Mrs. Klopton,&rdquo; McKnight called. &ldquo;The Cubs won, three
      to nothing.&rdquo; He listened, grinning, as she moved away with little
      irritated rustles of her black silk gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my packing, changed my collar and was ready to go. Then very
      cautiously we put out the light and opened the shutters. The window across
      was merely a deeper black in the darkness. It was closed and dirty. And
      yet, probably owing to Richey's suggestion, I had an uneasy sensation of
      eyes staring across at me. The next moment we were at the door, poised for
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to run for it,&rdquo; I said in a whisper. &ldquo;She's down there with a
      package of some sort, sandwiches probably. And she's threatened me with
      overshoes for a month. Ready now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had a kaleidoscopic view of Mrs. Klopton in the lower hall, holding out
      an armful of such traveling impedimenta as she deemed essential, while
      beside her, Euphemia, the colored housemaid, grinned over a white-wrapped
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully sorry-no time-back Sunday,&rdquo; I panted over my shoulder. Then the
      door closed and the car was moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight bent forward and stared at the facade of the empty house next
      door as we passed. It was black, staring, mysterious, as empty buildings
      are apt to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to hold a post-mortem on that corpse of a house,&rdquo; he said
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;By George, I've a notion to get out and take a look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody after the brass pipes,&rdquo; I scoffed. &ldquo;House has been empty for a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one hand on the steering wheel McKnight held out the other for my
      cigarette case. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I don't see what she would want
      with brass pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; I laughed outright. &ldquo;You have been looking too hard at the
      picture in the back of your watch, that's all. There's an experiment like
      that: if you stare long enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But McKnight was growing sulky: he sat looking rigidly ahead, and he did
      not speak again until he brought the Cannonball to a stop at the station.
      Even then it was only a perfunctory remark. He went through the gate with
      me, and with five minutes to spare, we lounged and smoked in the train
      shed. My mind had slid away from my surroundings and had wandered to a
      polo pony that I couldn't afford and intended to buy anyhow. Then McKnight
      shook off his taciturnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake, don't look so martyred,&rdquo; he burst out; &ldquo;I know you've
      done all the traveling this summer. I know you're missing a game
      to-morrow. But don't be a patient mother; confound it, I have to go to
      Richmond on Sunday. I&mdash;I want to see a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't mind me,&rdquo; I observed politely. &ldquo;Personally, I wouldn't change
      places with you. What's her name&mdash;North? South?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;West,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Don't try to be funny. And all I have to say,
      Blakeley, is that if you ever fall in love I hope you make an egregious
      ass of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In view of what followed, this came rather close to prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip west was without incident. I played bridge with a furniture
      dealer from Grand Rapids, a sales agent for a Pittsburg iron firm and a
      young professor from an eastern college. I won three rubbers out of four,
      finished what cigarettes McKnight had left me, and went to bed at one
      o'clock. It was growing cooler, and the rain had ceased. Once, toward
      morning, I wakened with a start, for no apparent reason, and sat bolt
      upright. I had an uneasy feeling that some one had been looking at me, the
      same sensation I had experienced earlier in the evening at the window. But
      I could feel the bag with the notes, between me and the window, and with
      my arm thrown over it for security, I lapsed again into slumber. Later,
      when I tried to piece together the fragments of that journey, I remembered
      that my coat, which had been folded and placed beyond my restless tossing,
      had been rescued in the morning from a heterogeneous jumble of blankets,
      evening papers and cravat, had been shaken out with profanity and donned
      with wrath. At the time, nothing occurred to me but the necessity of
      writing to the Pullman Company and asking them if they ever traveled in
      their own cars. I even formulated some of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are built to scale, why not take a man of ordinary stature as
      your unit?&rdquo; I wrote mentally. &ldquo;I can not fold together like the traveling
      cup with which I drink your abominable water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was more cheerful after I had had a cup of coffee in the Union Station.
      It was too early to attend to business, and I lounged in the restaurant
      and hid behind the morning papers. As I had expected, they had got hold of
      my visit and its object. On the first page was a staring announcement that
      the forged papers in the Bronson case had been brought to Pittsburg.
      Underneath, a telegram from Washington stated that Lawrence Blakeley, of
      Blakeley and McKnight, had left for Pittsburg the night before, and that,
      owing to the approaching trial of the Bronson case and the illness of John
      Gilmore, the Pittsburg millionaire, who was the chief witness for the
      prosecution, it was supposed that the visit was intimately concerned with
      the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked around apprehensively. There were no reporters yet in sight, and
      thankful to have escaped notice I paid for my breakfast and left. At the
      cab-stand I chose the least dilapidated hansom I could find, and giving
      the driver the address of the Gilmore residence, in the East end, I got
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just in time. As the cab turned and rolled off, a slim young man in
      a straw hat separated himself from a little group of men and hurried
      toward us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Wait a minute there!&rdquo; he called, breaking into a trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cabby did not hear, or perhaps did not care to. We jogged
      comfortably along, to my relief, leaving the young man far behind. I avoid
      reporters on principle, having learned long ago that I am an easy mark for
      a clever interviewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps nine o'clock when I left the station. Our way was along the
      boulevard which hugged the side of one of the city's great hills. Far
      below, to the left, lay the railroad tracks and the seventy times seven
      looming stacks of the mills. The white mist of the river, the grays and
      blacks of the smoke blended into a half-revealing haze, dotted here and
      there with fire. It was unlovely, tremendous. Whistler might have painted
      it with its pathos, its majesty, but he would have missed what made it
      infinitely suggestive&mdash;the rattle and roar of iron on iron, the
      rumble of wheels, the throbbing beat, against the ears, of fire and heat
      and brawn welding prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this I voiced to the grim old millionaire who was responsible
      for at least part of it. He was propped up in bed in his East end home,
      listening to the market reports read by a nurse, and he smiled a little at
      my enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see much beauty in it myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it's our badge of
      prosperity. The full dinner pail here means a nose that looks like a flue.
      Pittsburg without smoke wouldn't be Pittsburg, any more than New York
      without prohibition would be New York. Sit down for a few minutes, Mr.
      Blakeley. Now, Miss Gardner, Westinghouse Electric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse resumed her reading in a monotonous voice. She read literally
      and without understanding, using initials and abbreviations as they came.
      But the shrewd old man followed her easily. Once, however, he stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-o is ditto,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the nurse droned along, I found myself looking curiously at a
      photograph in a silver frame on the bed-side table. It was the picture of
      a girl in white, with her hands clasped loosely before her. Against the
      dark background her figure stood out slim and young. Perhaps it was the
      rather grim environment, possibly it was my mood, but although as a
      general thing photographs of young girls make no appeal to me, this one
      did. I found my eyes straying back to it. By a little finesse I even made
      out the name written across the corner, &ldquo;Alison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gilmore lay back among his pillows and listened to the nurse's
      listless voice. But he was watching me from under his heavy eyebrows, for
      when the reading was over, and we were alone, he indicated the picture
      with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep it there to remind myself that I am an old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is
      my granddaughter, Alison West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expressed the customary polite surprise, at which, finding me
      responsive, he told me his age with a chuckle of pride. More surprise,
      this time genuine. From that we went to what he ate for breakfast and did
      not eat for luncheon, and then to his reserve power, which at sixty-five
      becomes a matter for thought. And so, in a wide circle, back to where we
      started, the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father was a rascal,&rdquo; John Gilmore said, picking up the frame. &ldquo;The
      happiest day of my life was when I knew he was safely dead in bed and not
      hanged. If the child had looked like him, I&mdash;well, she doesn't. She's
      a Gilmore, every inch. Supposed to look like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very noticeably,&rdquo; I agreed soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had produced the notes by that time, and replacing the picture Mr.
      Gilmore gathered his spectacles from beside it. He went over the four
      notes methodically, examining each carefully and putting it down before he
      picked up the next. Then he leaned back and took off his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're not so bad,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Not so bad. But I never saw
      them before. That's my unofficial signature. I am inclined to think&mdash;&rdquo;
       he was speaking partly to himself&mdash;&ldquo;to think that he has got hold of
      a letter of mine, probably to Alison. Bronson was a friend of her
      rapscallion of a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took Mr. Gilmore's deposition and put it into my traveling-bag with the
      forged notes. When I saw them again, almost three weeks later, they were
      unrecognizable, a mass of charred paper on a copper ashtray. In the
      interval other and bigger things had happened: the Bronson forgery case
      had shrunk beside the greater and more imminent mystery of the man in
      lower ten. And Alison West had come into the story and into my life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. A TORN TELEGRAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      I lunched alone at the Gilmore house, and went back to the city at once.
      The sun had lifted the mists, and a fresh summer wind had cleared away the
      smoke pall. The boulevard was full of cars flying countryward for the
      Saturday half-holiday, toward golf and tennis, green fields and babbling
      girls. I gritted my teeth and thought of McKnight at Richmond, visiting
      the lady with the geographical name. And then, for the first time, I
      associated John Gilmore's granddaughter with the &ldquo;West&rdquo; that McKnight had
      irritably flung at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still carried my traveling-bag, for McKnight's vision at the window of
      the empty house had not been without effect. I did not transfer the notes
      to my pocket, and, if I had, it would not have altered the situation
      later. Only the other day McKnight put this very thing up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warned you,&rdquo; he reminded me. &ldquo;I told you there were queer things
      coming, and to be on your guard. You ought to have taken your revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been of exactly as much use as a bucket of snow in Africa,&rdquo;
       I retorted. &ldquo;If I had never closed my eyes, or if I had kept my finger on
      the trigger of a six-shooter (which is novelesque for revolver), the
      result would have been the same. And the next time you want a little
      excitement with every variety of thrill thrown in, I can put you by way of
      it. You begin by getting the wrong berth in a Pullman car, and end&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know how it ends,&rdquo; he finished shortly. &ldquo;Don't you suppose the
      whole thing's written on my spinal marrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I am wandering again. That is the difficulty with the unprofessional
      story-teller: he yaws back and forth and can't keep in the wind; he drops
      his characters overboard when he hasn't any further use for them and
      drowns them; he forgets the coffee-pot and the frying-pan and all the
      other small essentials, and, if he carries a love affair, he mutters a
      fervent &ldquo;Allah be praised&rdquo; when he lands them, drenched with adventures,
      at the matrimonial dock at the end of the final chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put in a thoroughly unsatisfactory afternoon. Time dragged eternally. I
      dropped in at a summer vaudeville, and bought some ties at a
      haberdasher's. I was bored but unexpectant; I had no premonition of what
      was to come. Nothing unusual had ever happened to me; friends of mine had
      sometimes sailed the high seas of adventure or skirted the coasts of
      chance, but all of the shipwrecks had occurred after a woman passenger had
      been taken on. &ldquo;Ergo,&rdquo; I had always said &ldquo;no women!&rdquo; I repeated it to
      myself that evening almost savagely, when I found my thoughts straying
      back to the picture of John Gilmore's granddaughter. I even argued as I
      ate my solitary dinner at a downtown restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you troubles enough,&rdquo; I reflected, &ldquo;without looking for more?
      Hasn't Bad News gone lame, with a matinee race booked for next week?
      Otherwise aren't you comfortable? Isn't your house in order? Do you want
      to sell a pony in order to have the library done over in mission or the
      drawing-room in gold? Do you want somebody to count the empty cigarette
      boxes lying around every morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lay it to the long idle afternoon, to the new environment, to anything you
      like, but I began to think that perhaps I did. I was confoundedly lonely.
      For the first time in my life its even course began to waver: the needle
      registered warning marks on the matrimonial seismograph, lines vague
      enough, but lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      My alligator bag lay at my feet, still locked. While I waited for my
      coffee I leaned back and surveyed the people incuriously. There were the
      usual couples intent on each other: my new state of mind made me regard
      them with tolerance. But at the next table, where a man and woman dined
      together, a different atmosphere prevailed. My attention was first caught
      by the woman's face. She had been speaking earnestly across the table, her
      profile turned to me. I had noticed casually her earnest manner, her
      somber clothes, and the great mass of odd, bronze-colored hair on her
      neck. But suddenly she glanced toward me and the utter hopelessness&mdash;almost
      tragedy&mdash;of her expression struck me with a shock. She half closed
      her eyes and drew a long breath, then she turned again to the man across
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither one was eating. He sat low in his chair, his chin on his chest,
      ugly folds of thick flesh protruding over his collar. He was probably
      fifty, bald, grotesque, sullen, and yet not without a suggestion of power.
      But he had been drinking; as I looked, he raised an unsteady hand and
      summoned a waiter with a wine list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman bent across the table and spoke again quickly. She had
      unconsciously raised her voice. Not beautiful, in her earnestness and
      stress she rather interested me. I had an idle inclination to advise the
      waiter to remove the bottled temptation from the table. I wonder what
      would have happened if I had? Suppose Harrington had not been intoxicated
      when he entered the Pullman car Ontario that night!
    </p>
    <p>
      For they were about to make a journey, I gathered, and the young woman
      wished to go alone. I drank three cups of coffee, which accounted for my
      wakefulness later, and shamelessly watched the tableau before me. The
      woman's protest evidently went for nothing: across the table the man
      grunted monosyllabic replies and grew more and more lowering and sullen.
      Once, during a brief unexpected pianissimo in the music, her voice came to
      me sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only see him in time!&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;Oh, it's terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my interest I would have forgotten the whole incident at once,
      erased it from my mind as one does the inessentials and clutterings of
      memory, had I not met them again, later that evening, in the Pennsylvania
      station. The situation between them had not visibly altered: the same
      dogged determination showed in the man's face, but the young woman&mdash;daughter
      or wife? I wondered&mdash;had drawn down her veil and I could only suspect
      what white misery lay beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought my berth after waiting in a line of some eight or ten people.
      When, step by step, I had almost reached the window, a tall woman whom I
      had not noticed before spoke to me from my elbow. She had a ticket and
      money in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try to get me a lower when you buy yours?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I have
      traveled for three nights in uppers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I consented, of course; beyond that I hardly noticed the woman. I had a
      vague impression of height and a certain amount of stateliness, but the
      crowd was pushing behind me, and some one was standing on my foot. I got
      two lowers easily, and, turning with the change and berths, held out the
      tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will you have?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Lower eleven or lower ten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank you very much indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At random I gave her lower eleven, and called a porter to help her with
      her luggage. I followed them leisurely to the train shed, and ten minutes
      more saw us under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked into my car, but it presented the peculiarly unattractive
      appearance common to sleepers. The berths were made up; the center aisle
      was a path between walls of dingy, breeze-repelling curtains, while the
      two seats at each end of the car were piled high with suitcases and
      umbrellas. The perspiring porter was trying to be six places at once:
      somebody has said that Pullman porters are black so they won't show the
      dirt, but they certainly show the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine-fifteen was an outrageous hour to go to bed, especially since I sleep
      little or not at all on the train, so I made my way to the smoker and
      passed the time until nearly eleven with cigarettes and a magazine. The
      car was very close. It was a warm night, and before turning in I stood a
      short time in the vestibule. The train had been stopping at frequent
      intervals, and, finding the brakeman there, I asked the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that there was a hot-box on the next car, and that not only were
      we late, but we were delaying the second section, just behind. I was
      beginning to feel pleasantly drowsy, and the air was growing cooler as we
      got into the mountains. I said good night to the brakeman and went back to
      my berth. To my surprise, lower ten was already occupied&mdash;a suit-case
      projected from beneath, a pair of shoes stood on the floor, and from
      behind the curtains came the heavy, unmistakable breathing of deep sleep.
      I hunted out the porter and together we investigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you asleep, sir?&rdquo; asked the porter, leaning over deferentially. No
      answer forthcoming, he opened the curtains and looked in. Yes, the
      intruder was asleep&mdash;very much asleep&mdash;and an overwhelming odor
      of whisky proclaimed that he would probably remain asleep until morning. I
      was irritated. The car was full, and I was not disposed to take an upper
      in order to allow this drunken interloper to sleep comfortably in my
      berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to get out of this,&rdquo; I said, shaking him angrily. But he
      merely grunted and turned over. As he did so, I saw his features for the
      first time. It was the quarrelsome man of the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was less disposed than ever to relinquish my claim, but the porter,
      after a little quiet investigation, offered a solution of the difficulty.
      &ldquo;There's no one in lower nine,&rdquo; he suggested, pulling open the curtains
      just across. &ldquo;It's likely nine's his berth, and he's made a mistake, owing
      to his condition. You'd better take nine, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did, with a firm resolution that if nine's rightful owner turned up
      later I should be just as unwakable as the man opposite. I undressed
      leisurely, making sure of the safety of the forged notes, and placing my
      grip as before between myself and the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a man of systematic habits, I arranged my clothes carefully, putting
      my shoes out for the porter to polish, and stowing my collar and scarf in
      the little hammock swung for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, with my pillows so arranged that I could see out comfortably, and
      with the unhygienic-looking blanket turned back&mdash;I have always a
      distrust of those much-used affairs&mdash;I prepared to wait gradually for
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sleep did not visit me. The train came to frequent, grating stops, and
      I surmised the hot box again. I am not a nervous man, but there was
      something chilling in the thought of the second section pounding along
      behind us. Once, as I was dozing, our locomotive whistled a shrill warning&mdash;&ldquo;You
      keep back where you belong,&rdquo; it screamed to my drowsy ears, and from
      somewhere behind came a chastened &ldquo;All-right-I-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I grew more and more wide-awake. At Cresson I got up on my elbow and
      blinked out at the station lights. Some passengers boarded the train there
      and I heard a woman's low tones, a southern voice, rich and full. Then
      quiet again. Every nerve was tense: time passed, perhaps ten minutes,
      possibly half an hour. Then, without the slightest warning, as the train
      rounded a curve, a heavy body was thrown into my berth. The incident,
      trivial as it seemed, was startling in its suddenness, for although my
      ears were painfully strained and awake, I had heard no step outside. The
      next instant the curtain hung limp again; still without a sound, my
      disturber had slipped away into the gloom and darkness. In a frenzy of
      wakefulness, I sat up, drew on a pair of slippers and fumbled for my
      bath-robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a berth across, probably lower ten, came that particular aggravating
      snore which begins lightly, delicately, faintly soprano, goes down the
      scale a note with every breath, and, after keeping the listener tense with
      expectation, ends with an explosion that tears the very air. I was more
      and more irritable: I sat on the edge of the berth and hoped the snorer
      would choke to death. He had considerable vitality, however; he withstood
      one shock after another and survived to start again with new vigor. In
      desperation I found some cigarettes and one match, piled my blankets over
      my grip, and drawing the curtains together as though the berth were still
      occupied, I made my way to the vestibule of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not clad for dress parade. Is it because the male is so restricted
      to gloom in his every-day attire that he blossoms into gaudy colors in his
      pajamas and dressing-gowns? It would take a Turk to feel at home before an
      audience in my red and yellow bathrobe, a Christmas remembrance from Mrs.
      Klopton, with slippers to match.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, naturally, when I saw a feminine figure on the platform, my first
      instinct was to dodge. The woman, however, was quicker than I; she gave me
      a startled glance, wheeled and disappeared, with a flash of two
      bronze-colored braids, into the next car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cigarette box in one hand, match in the other, I leaned against the
      uncertain frame of the door and gazed after her vanished figure. The
      mountain air flapped my bath-robe around my bare ankles, my one match
      burned to the end and went out, and still I stared. For I had seen on her
      expressive face a haunting look that was horror, nothing less. Heaven
      knows, I am not psychological. Emotions have to be written large before I
      can read them. But a woman in trouble always appeals to me, and this woman
      was more than that. She was in deadly fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had not been afraid of being ridiculous, I would have followed her.
      But I fancied that the apparition of a man in a red and yellow bath-robe,
      with an unkempt thatch of hair, walking up to her and assuring her that he
      would protect her would probably put her into hysterics. I had done that
      once before, when burglars had tried to break into the house, and had
      startled the parlor maid into bed for a week. So I tried to assure myself
      that I had imagined the lady's distress&mdash;or caused it, perhaps&mdash;and
      to dismiss her from my mind. Perhaps she was merely anxious about the
      unpleasant gentleman of the restaurant. I thought smugly that I could have
      told her all about him: that he was sleeping the sleep of the just and the
      intoxicated in a berth that ought, by all that was fair and right, to have
      been mine, and that if I were tied to a man who snored like that I should
      have him anesthetized and his soft palate put where it would never again
      flap like a loose sail in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed Harrisburg as I stood there. It was starlight, and the great
      crests of the Alleghanies had given way to low hills. At intervals we
      passed smudges of gray white, no doubt in daytime comfortable farms, which
      McKnight says is a good way of putting it, the farms being a lot more
      comfortable than the people on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was growing drowsy: the woman with the bronze hair and the horrified
      face was fading in retrospect. It was colder, too, and I turned with a
      shiver to go in. As I did so a bit of paper fluttered into the air and
      settled on my sleeve, like a butterfly on a gorgeous red and yellow
      blossom. I picked it up curiously and glanced at it. It was part of a
      telegram that had been torn into bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only parts of four words on the scrap, but it left me puzzled
      and thoughtful. It read, &ldquo;-ower ten, car seve-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower ten, car seven,&rdquo; was my berth-the one I had bought and found
      preempted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. ACROSS THE AISLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      No solution offering itself, I went back to my berth. The snorer across
      had apparently strangled, or turned over, and so after a time I dropped
      asleep, to be awakened by the morning sunlight across my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt for my watch, yawning prodigiously. I reached under the pillow and
      failed to find it, but something scratched the back of my hand. I sat up
      irritably and nursed the wound, which was bleeding a little. Still drowsy,
      I felt more cautiously for what I supposed had been my scarf pin, but
      there was nothing there. Wide awake now, I reached for my traveling-bag,
      on the chance that I had put my watch in there. I had drawn the satchel to
      me and had my hand on the lock before I realized that it was not my own!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine was of alligator hide. I had killed the beast in Florida, after the
      expenditure of enough money to have bought a house and enough energy to
      have built one. The bag I held in my hand was a black one, sealskin, I
      think. The staggering thought of what the loss of my bag meant to me put
      my finger on the bell and kept it there until the porter came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ring, sir?&rdquo; he asked, poking his head through the curtains
      obsequiously. McKnight objects that nobody can poke his head through a
      curtain and be obsequious. But Pullman porters can and do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;It rang itself. What in thunder do you mean by
      exchanging my valise for this one? You'll have to find it if you waken the
      entire car to do it. There are important papers in that grip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porter,&rdquo; called a feminine voice from an upper berth near-by. &ldquo;Porter, am
      I to dangle here all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her dangle,&rdquo; I said savagely. &ldquo;You find that bag of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter frowned. Then he looked at me with injured dignity. &ldquo;I brought
      in your overcoat, sir. You carried your own valise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow was right! In an excess of caution I had refused to relinquish
      my alligator bag, and had turned over my other traps to the porter. It was
      clear enough then. I was simply a victim of the usual sleeping-car
      robbery. I was in a lather of perspiration by that time: the lady down the
      car was still dangling and talking about it: still nearer a feminine voice
      was giving quick orders in French, presumably to a maid. The porter was on
      his knees, looking under the berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there, sir,&rdquo; he said, dusting his knees. He was visibly more
      cheerful, having been absolved of responsibility. &ldquo;Reckon it was taken
      while you was wanderin' around the car last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you fifty dollars if you find it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A hundred. Reach up
      my shoes and I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped abruptly. My eyes were fixed in stupefied amazement on a coat
      that hung from a hook at the foot of my berth. From the coat they
      traveled, dazed, to the soft-bosomed shirt beside it, and from there to
      the collar and cravat in the net hammock across the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred!&rdquo; the porter repeated, showing his teeth. But I caught him by
      the arm and pointed to the foot of the berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what color's that coat?&rdquo; I asked unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gray, sir.&rdquo; His tone was one of gentle reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;the trousers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached over and held up one creased leg. &ldquo;Gray, too,&rdquo; he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gray!&rdquo; I could not believe even his corroboration of my own eyes. &ldquo;But my
      clothes were blue!&rdquo; The porter was amused: he dived under the curtains and
      brought up a pair of shoes. &ldquo;Your shoes, sir,&rdquo; he said with a flourish.
      &ldquo;Reckon you've been dreaming, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, there are two things I always avoid in my dress&mdash;possibly an
      idiosyncrasy of my bachelor existence. These tabooed articles are red
      neckties and tan shoes. And not only were the shoes the porter lifted from
      the floor of a gorgeous shade of yellow, but the scarf which was run
      through the turned over collar was a gaudy red. It took a full minute for
      the real import of things to penetrate my dazed intelligence. Then I gave
      a vindictive kick at the offending ensemble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're not mine, any of them,&rdquo; I snarled. &ldquo;They are some other fellow's.
      I'll sit here until I take root before I put them on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're nice lookin' clothes,&rdquo; the porter put in, eying the red tie with
      appreciation. &ldquo;Ain't everybody would have left you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the conductor,&rdquo; I said shortly. Then a possible explanation occurred
      to me. &ldquo;Oh, porter&mdash;what's the number of this berth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven, sir. If you cain't wear those shoes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven!&rdquo; In my relief I almost shouted it. &ldquo;Why, then, it's simple enough.
      I'm in the wrong berth, that's all. My berth is nine. Only&mdash;where the
      deuce is the man who belongs here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely in nine, sir.&rdquo; The darky was enjoying himself. &ldquo;You and the other
      gentleman just got mixed in the night. That's all, sir.&rdquo; It was clear that
      he thought I had been drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew a long breath. Of course, that was the explanation. This was number
      seven's berth, that was his soft hat, this his umbrella, his coat, his
      bag. My rage turned to irritation at myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter went to the next berth and I could hear his softly insinuating
      voice. &ldquo;Time to get up, sir. Are you awake? Time to get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no response from number nine. I guessed that he had opened the
      curtains and was looking in. Then he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number nine's empty,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Empty! Do you mean my clothes aren't there?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;My valise? Why
      don't you answer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doan' give me time,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;There ain't nothin' there. But
      it's been slept in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disappointment was the greater for my few moments of hope. I sat up in
      a white fury and put on the clothes that had been left me. Then, still
      raging, I sat on the edge of the berth and put on the obnoxious tan shoes.
      The porter, called to his duties, made little excursions back to me, to
      offer assistance and to chuckle at my discomfiture. He stood by, outwardly
      decorous, but with little irritating grins of amusement around his mouth,
      when I finally emerged with the red tie in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet the owner of those clothes didn't become them any more than you do,&rdquo;
       he said, as he plied the ubiquitous whisk broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I get the owner of these clothes,&rdquo; I retorted grimly, &ldquo;he will need
      a shroud. Where's the conductor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conductor was coming, he assured me; also that there was no bag
      answering the description of mine on the car. I slammed my way to the
      dressing-room, washed, choked my fifteen and a half neck into a fifteen
      collar, and was back again in less than five minutes. The car, as well as
      its occupants, was gradually taking on a daylight appearance. I hobbled
      in, for one of the shoes was abominably tight, and found myself facing a
      young woman in blue with an unforgettable face. (&ldquo;Three women already.&rdquo;
       McKnight says: &ldquo;That's going some, even if you don't count the Gilmore
      nurse.&rdquo;) She stood, half-turned toward me, one hand idly drooping, the
      other steadying her as she gazed out at the flying landscape. I had an
      instant impression that I had met her somewhere, under different
      circumstances, more cheerful ones, I thought, for the girl's dejection now
      was evident. Beside her, sitting down, a small dark woman, considerably
      older, was talking in a rapid undertone. The girl nodded indifferently now
      and then. I fancied, although I was not sure, that my appearance brought a
      startled look into the young woman's face. I sat down and, hands thrust
      deep into the other man's pockets, stared ruefully at the other man's
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage was set. In a moment the curtain was going up on the first act
      of the play. And for a while we would all say our little speeches and sing
      our little songs, and I, the villain, would hold center stage while the
      gallery hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter was standing beside lower ten. He had reached in and was
      knocking valiantly. But his efforts met with no response. He winked at me
      over his shoulder; then he unfastened the curtains and bent forward.
      Behind him, I saw him stiffen, heard his muttered exclamation, saw the
      bluish pallor that spread over his face and neck. As he retreated a step
      the interior of lower ten lay open to the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in it was on his back, the early morning sun striking full on his
      upturned face. But the light did not disturb him. A small stain of red
      dyed the front of his night clothes and trailed across the sheet; his
      half-open eyes were fixed, without seeing, on the shining wood above.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grasped the porter's shaking shoulders and stared down to where the
      train imparted to the body a grisly suggestion of motion. &ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; I
      gasped. &ldquo;The man's been murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. NUMBERS SEVEN AND NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when I tried to recall our discovery of the body in lower ten,
      I found that my most vivid impression was not that made by the revelation
      of the opened curtain. I had an instantaneous picture of a slender
      blue-gowned girl who seemed to sense my words rather than hear them, of
      two small hands that clutched desperately at the seat beside them. The
      girl in the aisle stood, bent toward us, perplexity and alarm fighting in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      With twitching hands the porter attempted to draw the curtains together.
      Then in a paralysis of shock, he collapsed on the edge of my berth and sat
      there swaying. In my excitement I shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, keep your nerve, man,&rdquo; I said bruskly. &ldquo;You'll have
      every woman in the car in hysterics. And if you do, you'll wish you could
      change places with the man in there.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man near, who had been reading last night's paper, dropped it quickly
      and tiptoed toward us. He peered between the partly open curtains, closed
      them quietly and went back, ostentatiously solemn, to his seat. The very
      crackle with which he opened his paper added to the bursting curiosity of
      the car. For the passengers knew that something was amiss: I was conscious
      of a sudden tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the curtains closed the porter was more himself; he wiped his lips
      with a handkerchief and stood erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my last trip in this car,&rdquo; he remarked heavily. &ldquo;There's something
      wrong with that berth. Last trip the woman in it took an overdose of some
      sleeping stuff, and we found her, jes' like that, dead! And it ain't
      more'n three months now since there was twins born in that very spot. No,
      sir, it ain't natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a thin man with prominent eyes and a spare grayish goatee
      creaked up the aisle and paused beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porter sick?&rdquo; he inquired, taking in with a professional eye the porter's
      horror-struck face, my own excitement and the slightly gaping curtains of
      lower ten. He reached for the darky's pulse and pulled out an
      old-fashioned gold watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Only fifty! What's the matter? Had a shock?&rdquo; he asked shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered for the porter. &ldquo;We've both had one. If you are a
      doctor, I wish you would look at the man in the berth across, lower ten.
      I'm afraid it's too late, but I'm not experienced in such matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together we opened the curtains, and the doctor, bending down, gave a
      comprehensive glance that took in the rolling head, the relaxed jaw, the
      ugly stain on the sheet. The examination needed only a moment. Death was
      written in the clear white of the nostrils, the colorless lips, the
      smoothing away of the sinister lines of the night before. With its new
      dignity the face was not unhandsome: the gray hair was still plentiful,
      the features strong and well cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor straightened himself and turned to me. &ldquo;Dead for some time,&rdquo; he
      said, running a professional finger over the stains. &ldquo;These are dry and
      darkened, you see, and rigor mortis is well established. A friend of
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know him at all,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Never saw him but once before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't know if he is traveling alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was not&mdash;that is, I don't know anything about him,&rdquo; I
      corrected myself. It was my first blunder: the doctor glanced up at me
      quickly and then turned his attention again to the body. Like a flash
      there had come to me the vision of the woman with the bronze hair and the
      tragic face, whom I had surprised in the vestibule between the cars,
      somewhere in the small hours of the morning. I had acted on my first
      impulse&mdash;the masculine one of shielding a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had unfastened the coat of the striped pajamas and exposed the
      dead man's chest. On the left side was a small punctured wound of
      insignificant size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very neatly done,&rdquo; the doctor said with appreciation. &ldquo;Couldn't have done
      it better myself. Right through the intercostal space: no time even to
      grunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't the heart around there somewhere?&rdquo; I asked. The medical man turned
      toward me and smiled austerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where it belongs, just under that puncture, when it isn't gadding
      around in a man's throat or his boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had a new respect for the doctor, for any one indeed who could crack
      even a feeble joke under such circumstances, or who could run an
      impersonal finger over that wound and those stains. Odd how a healthy,
      normal man holds the medical profession in half contemptuous regard until
      he gets sick, or an emergency like this arises, and then turns meekly to
      the man who knows the ins and outs of his mortal tenement, takes his pills
      or his patronage, ties to him like a rudderless ship in a gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suicide, is it, doctor?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood erect, after drawing the bed-clothing over the face, and, taking
      off his glasses, he wiped them slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not suicide,&rdquo; he announced decisively. &ldquo;It is murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I had expected that, but the word itself brought a shiver. I
      was just a bit dizzy. Curious faces through the car were turned toward us,
      and I could hear the porter behind me breathing audibly. A stout woman in
      negligee came down the aisle and querulously confronted the porter. She
      wore a pink dressing-jacket and carried portions of her clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porter,&rdquo; she began, in the voice of the lady who had &ldquo;dangled,&rdquo; &ldquo;is there
      a rule of this company that will allow a woman to occupy the dressing-room
      for one hour and curl her hair with an alcohol lamp while respectable
      people haven't a place where they can hook their&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly and stared into lower ten. Her shining pink cheeks
      grew pasty, her jaw fell. I remember trying to think of something to say,
      and of saying nothing at all. Then&mdash;she had buried her eyes in the
      nondescript garments that hung from her arm and tottered back the way she
      had come. Slowly a little knot of men gathered around us, silent for the
      most part. The doctor was making a search of the berth when the conductor
      elbowed his way through, followed by the inquisitive man, who had
      evidently summoned him. I had lost sight, for a time, of the girl in blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it himself?&rdquo; the conductor queried, after a businesslike glance at the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't,&rdquo; the doctor asserted. &ldquo;There's no weapon here, and the
      window is closed. He couldn't have thrown it out, and he didn't swallow
      it. What on earth are you looking for, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one was on the floor at our feet, face down, head peering under the
      berth. Now he got up without apology, revealing the man who had summoned
      the conductor. He was dusty, alert, cheerful, and he dragged up with him
      the dead man's suit-case. The sight of it brought back to me at once my
      own predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether there's any connection or not, conductor,&rdquo; I said,
      &ldquo;but I am a victim, too, in less degree; I've been robbed of everything I
      possess, except a red and yellow bath-robe. I happened to be wearing the
      bath-robe, which was probably the reason the thief overlooked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a fresh murmur in the crowd. Some body laughed nervously. The
      conductor was irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bother with that now,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;The railroad company is
      responsible for transportation, not for clothes, jewelry and morals. If
      people want to be stabbed and robbed in the company's cars, it's their
      affair. Why didn't you sleep in your clothes? I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took an angry step forward. Then somebody touched my arm, and I
      unclenched my fist. I could understand the conductor's position, and
      beside, in the law, I had been guilty myself of contributory negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not trying to make you responsible,&rdquo; I protested as amiably as I
      could, &ldquo;and I believe the clothes the thief left are as good as my own.
      They are certainly newer. But my valise contained valuable papers and it
      is to your interest as well as mine to find the man who stole it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; the conductor said shrewdly. &ldquo;Find the man who skipped
      out with this gentleman's clothes, and you've probably got the murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to bed in lower nine,&rdquo; I said, my mind full again of my lost
      papers, &ldquo;and I wakened in number seven. I was up in the night prowling
      around, as I was unable to sleep, and I must have gone back to the wrong
      berth. Anyhow, until the porter wakened me this morning I knew nothing of
      my mistake. In the interval the thief&mdash;murderer, too, perhaps&mdash;must
      have come back, discovered my error, and taken advantage of it to further
      his escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inquisitive man looked at me from between narrowed eyelids,
      ferret-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any one on the train suspect you of having valuable papers?&rdquo; he
      inquired. The crowd was listening intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; I answered promptly and positively. The doctor was investigating
      the murdered man's effects. The pockets of his trousers contained the
      usual miscellany of keys and small change, while in his hip pocket was
      found a small pearl-handled revolver of the type women usually keep
      around. A gold watch with a Masonic charm had slid down between the
      mattress and the window, while a showy diamond stud was still fastened in
      the bosom of his shirt. Taken as a whole, the personal belongings were
      those of a man of some means, but without any particular degree of
      breeding. The doctor heaped them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either robbery was not the motive,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;or the thief
      overlooked these things in his hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter hypothesis seemed the more tenable, when, after a thorough
      search, we found no pocketbook and less than a dollar in small change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suit-case gave no clue. It contained one empty leather-covered flask
      and a pint bottle, also empty, a change of linen and some collars with the
      laundry mark, S. H. In the leather tag on the handle was a card with the
      name Simon Harrington, Pittsburg. The conductor sat down on my unmade
      berth, across, and made an entry of the name and address. Then, on an old
      envelope, he wrote a few words and gave it to the porter, who disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that's all I can do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've had enough trouble this trip
      to last for a year. They don't need a conductor on these trains any more;
      what they ought to have is a sheriff and a posse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter from the next car came in and whispered to him. The conductor
      rose unhappily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next car's caught the disease,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Doctor, a woman back there
      has got mumps or bubonic plague, or something. Will you come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange porter stood aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady about the middle of the car,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in black, sir, with
      queer-looking hair&mdash;sort of copper color, I think, sir.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V. THE WOMAN IN THE NEXT CAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the departure of the conductor and the doctor, the group around lower
      ten broke up, to re-form in smaller knots through the car. The porter
      remained on guard. With something of relief I sank into a seat. I wanted
      to think, to try to remember the details of the previous night. But my
      inquisitive acquaintance had other intentions. He came up and sat down
      beside me. Like the conductor, he had taken notes of the dead man's
      belongings, his name, address, clothing and the general circumstances of
      the crime. Now with his little note-book open before him, he prepared to
      enjoy the minor sensation of the robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for the second victim,&rdquo; he began cheerfully. &ldquo;What is your name
      and address, please?&rdquo; I eyed him with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost everything but my name and address,&rdquo; I parried. &ldquo;What do you
      want them for? Publication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; dear, no!&rdquo; he said, shocked at my misapprehension. &ldquo;Merely for my
      own enlightenment. I like to gather data of this kind and draw my own
      conclusions. Most interesting and engrossing. Once or twice I have
      forestalled the results of police investigation&mdash;but entirely for my
      own amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded tolerantly. Most of us have hobbies; I knew a man once who
      carried his handkerchief up his sleeve and had a mania for old colored
      prints cut out of Godey's Lady's Book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I use that inductive method originated by Poe and followed since with
      such success by Conan Doyle. Have you ever read Gaboriau? Ah, you have
      missed a treat, indeed. And now, to get down to business, what is the name
      of our escaped thief and probable murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth do I know?&rdquo; I demanded impatiently. &ldquo;He didn't write it in
      blood anywhere, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man looked hurt and disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that the pockets of those clothes are
      entirely empty?&rdquo; The pockets! In the excitement I had forgotten entirely
      the sealskin grip which the porter now sat at my feet, and I had not
      investigated the pockets at all. With the inquisitive man's pencil taking
      note of everything that I found, I emptied them on the opposite seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upper left-hand waist-coat, two lead pencils and a fountain pen; lower
      right waist-coat, match-box and a small stamp book; right-hand pocket
      coat, pair of gray suede gloves, new, size seven and a half; left-hand
      pocket, gun-metal cigarette case studded with pearls, half-full of
      Egyptian cigarettes. The trousers pockets contained a gold penknife, a
      small amount of money in bills and change, and a handkerchief with the
      initial &ldquo;S&rdquo; on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further search through the coat discovered a card-case with cards bearing
      the name Henry Pinckney Sullivan, and a leather flask with gold mountings,
      filled with what seemed to be very fair whisky, and monogrammed H. P. S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name evidently is Henry Pinckney Sullivan,&rdquo; said the cheerful
      follower of Poe, as he wrote it down. &ldquo;Address as yet unknown. Blond,
      probably. Have you noticed that it is almost always the blond men who
      affect a very light gray, with a touch of red in the scarf? Fact, I assure
      you. I kept a record once of the summer attire of men, and ninety per
      cent, followed my rule. Dark men like you affect navy blue, or brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of myself I was amused at the man's shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the suit he took was dark&mdash;a blue,&rdquo; I said. He rubbed his hands
      and smiled at me delightedly. &ldquo;Then you wore black shoes, not tan,&rdquo; he
      said, with a glance at the aggressive yellow ones I wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right again,&rdquo; I acknowledged. &ldquo;Black low shoes and black embroidered
      hose. If you keep on you'll have a motive for the crime, and the
      murderer's present place of hiding. And if you come back to the smoker
      with me, I'll give you an opportunity to judge if he knew good whisky from
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put the articles from the pockets back again and got up. &ldquo;I wonder if
      there is a diner on?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I need something sustaining after all
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was conscious then of some one at my elbow. I turned to see the young
      woman whose face was so vaguely familiar. In the very act of speaking she
      drew back suddenly and colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;I&mdash;thought you
      were&mdash;some one else.&rdquo; She was looking in a puzzled fashion at my
      coat. I felt all the cringing guilt of a man who has accidentally picked
      up the wrong umbrella: my borrowed collar sat tight on my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; I said idiotically. &ldquo;I'm sorry, but&mdash;I'm not.&rdquo; I have
      learned since that she has bright brown hair, with a loose wave in it that
      drops over her ears, and dark blue eyes with black lashes and&mdash;but
      what does it matter? One enjoys a picture as a whole: not as the sum of
      its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the flask then, and her errand came back to her. &ldquo;One of the
      ladies at the end of car has fainted,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I thought perhaps a
      stimulant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I picked up the flask at once and followed my guide down the aisle. Two or
      three women were working over the woman who had fainted. They had opened
      her collar and taken out her hairpins, whatever good that might do. The
      stout woman was vigorously rubbing her wrists, with the idea, no doubt, of
      working up her pulse! The unconscious woman was the one for whom I had
      secured lower eleven at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      I poured a little liquor in a bungling masculine fashion between her lips
      as she leaned back, with closed eyes. She choked, coughed, and rallied
      somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said the stout lady. &ldquo;As she lies back that way I could
      almost think it was my mother; she used to faint so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would make anybody faint,&rdquo; chimed in another. &ldquo;Murder and robbery in
      one night and on one car. I'm thankful I always wear my rings in a bag
      around my neck&mdash;even if they do get under me and keep me awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl in blue was looking at us with wide, startled eyes. I saw her
      pale a little, saw the quick, apprehensive glance which she threw at her
      traveling companion, the small woman I had noticed before. There was an
      exchange&mdash;almost a clash&mdash;of glances. The small woman frowned.
      That was all. I turned my attention again to my patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had revived somewhat, and now she asked to have the window opened. The
      train had stopped again and the car was oppressively hot. People around
      were looking at their watches and grumbling over the delay. The doctor
      bustled in with a remark about its being his busy day. The amateur
      detective and the porter together mounted guard over lower ten. Outside
      the heat rose in shimmering waves from the tracks: the very wood of the
      car was hot to touch. A Camberwell Beauty darted through the open door and
      made its way, in erratic plunges, great wings waving, down the sunny
      aisle. All around lay the peace of harvested fields, the quiet of the
      country.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE GIRL IN BLUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was growing more and more irritable. The thought of what the loss of the
      notes meant was fast crowding the murder to the back of my mind. The
      forced inaction was intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter had reported no bag answering the description of mine on the
      train, but I was disposed to make my own investigation. I made a tour of
      the cars, scrutinizing every variety of hand luggage, ranging from
      luxurious English bags with gold mountings to the wicker nondescripts of
      the day coach at the rear. I was not alone in my quest, for the girl in
      blue was just ahead of me. Car by car she preceded me through the train,
      unconscious that I was behind her, looking at each passenger as she
      passed. I fancied the proceeding was distasteful, but that she had
      determined on a course and was carrying it through. We reached the end of
      the train almost together&mdash;empty-handed, both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl went out to the platform. When she saw me she moved aside, and I
      stepped out beside her. Behind us the track curved sharply; the early
      sunshine threw the train, in long black shadow, over the hot earth.
      Forward somewhere they were hammering. The girl said nothing, but her
      profile was strained and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;if you have lost anything,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;I wish you would let me try
      to help. Not that my own success is anything to boast of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hardly glanced at me. It was not flattering. &ldquo;I have not been robbed,
      if that is what you mean,&rdquo; she replied quietly. &ldquo;I am&mdash;perplexed.
      That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to say to that. I lifted my hat&mdash;the other fellow's
      hat&mdash;and turned to go back to my car. Two or three members of the
      train crew, including the conductor, were standing in the shadow talking.
      And at that moment, from a farm-house near came the swift clang of the
      breakfast bell, calling in the hands from barn and pasture. I turned back
      to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may be here for an hour,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and there is no buffet car on. If I
      remember my youth, that bell means ham and eggs and country butter and
      coffee. If you care to run the risk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not hungry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but perhaps a cup of coffee&mdash;dear me, I
      believe I am hungry,&rdquo; she finished. &ldquo;Only&mdash;&rdquo; She glanced back of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can bring your companion,&rdquo; I suggested, without enthusiasm. But the
      young woman shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not hungry,&rdquo; she objected, &ldquo;and she is very&mdash;well, I know she
      wouldn't come. Do you suppose we could make it if we run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any idea,&rdquo; I said cheerfully. &ldquo;Any old train would be better
      than this one, if it does leave us behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Any train would be better than this one,&rdquo; she repeated gravely. I
      found myself watching her changing expression. I had spoken two dozen
      words to her and already I felt that I knew the lights and shades in her
      voice,&mdash;I, who had always known how a woman rode to hounds, and who
      never could have told the color of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped down on the ties and turned to assist her, and together we
      walked back to where the conductor and the porter from our car were in
      close conversation. Instinctively my hand went to my cigarette pocket and
      came out empty. She saw the gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to smoke, you may,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have a big cousin who smokes
      all the time. He says I am 'kippered.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew out the gun-metal cigarette case and opened it. But this most
      commonplace action had an extraordinary result: the girl beside me stopped
      dead still and stood staring at it with fascinated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;where did you get that?&rdquo; she demanded, with a catch in her
      voice; her gaze still fixed on the cigarette case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you haven't heard the rest of the tragedy?&rdquo; I asked, holding out the
      case. &ldquo;It's frightfully bad luck for me, but it makes a good story. You
      see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the conductor and porter ceased their colloquy. The
      conductor came directly toward me, tugging as he came at his bristling
      gray mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to talk to you in the car,&rdquo; he said to me, with a curious
      glance at the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't it wait?&rdquo; I objected. &ldquo;We are on our way to a cup of coffee and a
      slice of bacon. Be merciful, as you are powerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid the breakfast will have to wait,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I won't keep
      you long.&rdquo; There was a note of authority in his voice which I resented;
      but, after all, the circumstances were unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to defer that cup of coffee for a while,&rdquo; I said to the girl;
      &ldquo;but don't despair; there's breakfast somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we entered the car, she stood aside, but I felt rather than saw that
      she followed us. I was surprised to see a half dozen men gathered around
      the berth in which I had wakened, number seven. It had not yet been made
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we passed along the aisle, I was conscious of a new expression on the
      faces of the passengers. The tall woman who had fainted was searching my
      face with narrowed eyes, while the stout woman of the kindly heart avoided
      my gaze, and pretended to look out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we pushed our way through the group, I fancied that it closed around me
      ominously. The conductor said nothing, but led the way without ceremony to
      the side of the berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I inquired. I was puzzled, but not apprehensive.
      &ldquo;Have you some of my things? I'd be thankful even for my shoes; these are
      confoundedly tight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody spoke, and I fell silent, too. For one of the pillows had been
      turned over, and the under side of the white case was streaked with
      brownish stains. I think it was a perceptible time before I realized that
      the stains were blood, and that the faces around were filled with
      suspicion and distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&mdash;that looks like blood,&rdquo; I said vacuously. There was an
      incessant pounding in my ears, and the conductor's voice came from far
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is blood,&rdquo; he asserted grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked around with a dizzy attempt at nonchalance. &ldquo;Even if it is,&rdquo; I
      remonstrated, &ldquo;surely you don't suppose for a moment that I know anything
      about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amateur detective elbowed his way in. He had a scrap of transparent
      paper in his hand, and a pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like permission to trace the stains,&rdquo; he began eagerly. &ldquo;Also&rdquo;&mdash;to
      me&mdash;&ldquo;if you will kindly jab your finger with a pin&mdash;needle&mdash;anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't keep out of this,&rdquo; the conductor said savagely, &ldquo;I will do
      some jabbing myself. As for you, sir&mdash;&rdquo; he turned to me. I was
      absolutely innocent, but I knew that I presented a typical picture of
      guilt; I was covered with cold sweat, and the pounding in my ears kept up
      dizzily. &ldquo;As for you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The irrepressible amateur detective made a quick pounce at the pillow and
      pushed back the cover. Before our incredulous eyes he drew out a narrow
      steel dirk which had been buried to the small cross that served as a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a chorus of voices around, a quick surging forward of the crowd.
      So that was what had scratched my hand! I buried the wound in my coat
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak naturally, &ldquo;doesn't that prove what I have
      been telling you? The man who committed the murder belonged to this berth,
      and made an exchange in some way after the crime. How do you know he
      didn't change the tags so I would come back to this berth?&rdquo; This was an
      inspiration; I was pleased with it. &ldquo;That's what he did, he changed the
      tags,&rdquo; I reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of assent around. The doctor, who was standing beside
      me, put his hand on my arm. &ldquo;If this gentleman committed this crime, and I
      for one feel sure he did not, then who is the fellow who got away? And why
      did he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have only one man's word for that,&rdquo; the conductor snarled. &ldquo;I've
      traveled some in these cars myself, and no one ever changed berths with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody on the edge of the group asserted that hereafter he would travel
      by daylight. I glanced up and caught the eye of the girl in blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all mad,&rdquo; she said. Her tone was low, but I heard her
      distinctly. &ldquo;Don't take them seriously enough to defend yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think I didn't do it,&rdquo; I observed meekly, over the crowd.
      &ldquo;Nothing else is of any importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conductor had pulled out his note-book again. &ldquo;Your name, please,&rdquo; he
      said gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawrence Blakeley, Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attorney. A member of the firm of Blakeley and McKnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blakeley, you say you have occupied the wrong berth and have been
      robbed. Do you know anything of the man who did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only from what he left behind,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;These clothes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They fit you,&rdquo; he said with quick suspicion. &ldquo;Isn't that rather a
      coincidence? You are a large man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens,&rdquo; I retorted, stung into fury, &ldquo;do I look like a man who
      would wear this kind of a necktie? Do you suppose I carry purple and green
      barred silk handkerchiefs? Would any man in his senses wear a pair of
      shoes a full size too small?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conductor was inclined to hedge. &ldquo;You will have to grant that I am in
      a peculiar position,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have only your word as to the exchange
      of berths, and you understand I am merely doing my duty. Are there any
      clues in the pockets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time I emptied them of their contents, which he noted. &ldquo;Is
      that all?&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;There was nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not all, sir,&rdquo; broke in the porter, stepping forward. &ldquo;There was a
      small black satchel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I forgot the bag. I don't even know where it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The easily swayed crowd looked suspicious again. I've grown so accustomed
      to reading the faces of a jury, seeing them swing from doubt to belief,
      and back again to doubt, that I instinctively watch expressions. I saw
      that my forgetfulness had done me harm&mdash;that suspicion was roused
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bag was found a couple of seats away, under somebody's raincoat&mdash;another
      dubious circumstance. Was I hiding it? It was brought to the berth and
      placed beside the conductor, who opened it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained the usual traveling impedimenta&mdash;change of linen,
      collars, handkerchiefs, a bronze-green scarf, and a safety razor. But the
      attention of the crowd riveted itself on a flat, Russia leather wallet,
      around which a heavy gum band was wrapped, and which bore in gilt letters
      the name &ldquo;Simon Harrington.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. A FINE GOLD CHAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conductor held it out to me, his face sternly accusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this another coincidence?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did the man who left you his
      clothes and the barred silk handkerchief and the tight shoes leave you the
      spoil of the murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men standing around had drawn off a little, and I saw the absolute
      futility of any remonstrance. Have you ever seen a fly, who, in these
      hygienic days, finding no cobwebs to entangle him, is caught in a sheet of
      fly paper, finds himself more and more mired, and is finally quiet with
      the sticky stillness of despair?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I was the fly. I had seen too much of circumstantial evidence to
      have any belief that the establishing of my identity would weigh much
      against the other incriminating details. It meant imprisonment and trial,
      probably, with all the notoriety and loss of practice they would entail. A
      man thinks quickly at a time like that. All the probable consequences of
      the finding of that pocket-book flashed through my mind as I extended my
      hand to take it. Then I drew my arm back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Look inside. Maybe the other man took the
      money and left the wallet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conductor opened it, and again there was a curious surging forward of
      the crowd. To my intense disappointment the money was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood blankly miserable while it was counted out&mdash;five
      one-hundred-dollar bills, six twenties, and some fives and ones that
      brought the total to six hundred and fifty dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man with the note-book insisted on taking the numbers of the
      notes, to the conductor's annoyance. It was immaterial to me: small things
      had lost their power to irritate. I was seeing myself in the prisoner's
      box, going through all the nerve-racking routine of a trial for murder&mdash;the
      challenging of the jury, the endless cross-examinations, the alternate
      hope and fear. I believe I said before that I had no nerves, but for a few
      minutes that morning I was as near as a man ever comes to hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      I folded my arms and gave myself a mental shake. I seemed to be the center
      of a hundred eyes, expressing every shade of doubt and distrust, but I
      tried not to flinch. Then some one created a diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amateur detective was busy again with the seal-skin bag, investigating
      the make of the safety razor and the manufacturer's name on the
      bronze-green tie. Now, however, he paused and frowned, as though some pet
      theory had been upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from a corner of the bag he drew out and held up for our inspection
      some three inches of fine gold chain, one end of which was blackened and
      stained with blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor held out his hand for it, but the little man was not ready
      to give it up. He turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say no watch was left you? Was there a piece of chain like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No chain at all,&rdquo; I said sulkily. &ldquo;No jewelry of any kind, except plain
      gold buttons in the shirt I am wearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your glasses?&rdquo; he threw at me suddenly: instinctively my hand
      went to my eyes. My glasses had been gone all morning, and I had not even
      noticed their absence. The little man smiled cynically and held out the
      chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you to examine this,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Isn't it a part of the
      fine gold chain you wear over your ear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn't want to touch the thing: the stain at the end made me shudder.
      But with a baker's dozen of suspicious eyes&mdash;well, we'll say
      fourteen: there were no one-eyed men&mdash;I took the fragment in the tips
      of my fingers and looked at it helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine chains are much alike,&rdquo; I managed to say. &ldquo;For all I know, this
      may be mine, but I don't know how it got into that sealskin bag. I never
      saw the bag until this morning after daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He admits that he had the bag,&rdquo; somebody said behind me. &ldquo;How did you
      guess that he wore glasses, anyhow?&rdquo; to the amateur sleuth.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman cleared his throat. &ldquo;There were two reasons,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
      suspecting it. When you see a man with the lines of his face drooping, a
      healthy individual with a pensive eye,&mdash;suspect astigmatism. Besides,
      this gentleman has a pronounced line across the bridge of his nose and a
      mark on his ear from the chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this remarkable exhibition of the theoretical as combined with the
      practical, he sank into a seat near-by, and still holding the chain, sat
      with closed eyes and pursed lips. It was evident to all the car that the
      solution of the mystery was a question of moments. Once he bent forward
      eagerly and putting the chain on the window-sill, proceeded to go over it
      with a pocket magnifying glass, only to shake his head in disappointment.
      All the people around shook their heads too, although they had not the
      slightest idea what it was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pounding in my ears began again. The group around me seemed to be
      suddenly motionless in the very act of moving, as if a hypnotist had
      called &ldquo;Rigid!&rdquo; The girl in blue was looking at me, and above the din I
      thought she said she must speak to me&mdash;something vital. The pounding
      grew louder and merged into a scream. With a grinding and splintering the
      car rose under my feet. Then it fell away into darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE SECOND SECTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever been picked up out of your three-meals-a-day life, whirled
      around in a tornado of events, and landed in a situation so grotesque and
      yet so horrible that you laugh even while you are groaning, and straining
      at its hopelessness? McKnight says that is hysteria, and that no man
      worthy of the name ever admits to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, as McKnight says, it sounds like a tank drama. Just as the revolving
      saw is about to cut the hero into stove lengths, the second villain blows
      up the sawmill. The hero goes up through the roof and alights on the bank
      of a stream at the feet of his lady love, who is making daisy chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when I was safely home again, with Mrs. Klopton brewing
      strange drinks that came in paper packets from the pharmacy, and that
      smelled to heaven, I remember staggering to the door and closing it, and
      then going back to bed and howling out the absurdity and the madness of
      the whole thing. And while I laughed my very soul was sick, for the girl
      was gone by that time, and I knew by all the loyalty that answers between
      men for honor that I would have to put her out of my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, all the night that followed, filled as it was with the shrieking
      demons of pain, I saw her as I had seen her last, in the queer hat with
      green ribbons. I told the doctor this, guardedly, the next morning, and he
      said it was the morphia, and that I was lucky not to have seen a row of
      devils with green tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know anything about the wreck of September ninth last. You who
      swallowed the details with your coffee and digested the horrors with your
      chop, probably know a great deal more than I do. I remember very
      distinctly that the jumping and throbbing in my arm brought me back to a
      world that at first was nothing but sky, a heap of clouds that I thought
      hazily were the meringue on a blue charlotte russe. As the sense of
      hearing was slowly added to vision, I heard a woman near me sobbing that
      she had lost her hat pin, and she couldn't keep her hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I dropped back into unconsciousness again, for the next thing I
      remember was of my blue patch of sky clouded with smoke, of a strange
      roaring and crackling, of a rain of fiery sparks on my face and of
      somebody beating at me with feeble hands. I opened my eyes and closed them
      again: the girl in blue was bending over me. With that imperviousness to
      big things and keenness to small that is the first effect of shock, I
      tried to be facetious, when a spark stung my cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to rouse yourself!&rdquo; the girl was repeating desperately.
      &ldquo;You've been on fire twice already.&rdquo; A piece of striped ticking floated
      slowly over my head. As the wind caught it its charring edges leaped into
      flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like a kite, doesn't it?&rdquo; I remarked cheerfully. And then, as my
      arm gave an excruciating throb&mdash;&ldquo;Jove, how my arm hurts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl bent over and spoke slowly, distinctly, as one might speak to a
      deaf person or a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Mr. Blakeley,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;You must rouse yourself.
      There has been a terrible accident. The second section ran into us. The
      wreck is burning now, and if we don't move, we will catch fire. Do you
      hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice and my arm were bringing me to my senses. &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll
      sit up in a second. Are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only bruised. Do you think you can walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew up one foot after another, gingerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to move all right,&rdquo; I remarked dubiously. &ldquo;Would you mind
      telling me where the back of my head has gone? I can't help thinking it
      isn't there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a quick examination. &ldquo;It's pretty badly bumped,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      must have fallen on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had got up on my uninjured elbow by that time, but the pain threw me
      back. &ldquo;Don't look at the wreck,&rdquo; I entreated her. &ldquo;It's no sight for a
      woman. If&mdash;if there is any way to tie up this arm, I might be able to
      do something. There may be people under those cars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is too late to help,&rdquo; she replied solemnly. A little shower of
      feathers, each carrying its fiery lamp, blew over us from some burning
      pillow. A part the wreck collapsed with a crash. In a resolute to play a
      man's part in the tragedy going on around, I got to my knees. Then I
      realized what had not noticed before: the hand and wrist of the broken
      left arm were jammed through the handle of the sealskin grip. I gasped and
      sat down suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not do that,&rdquo; the girl insisted. I noticed now that she kept her
      back to the wreck, her eyes averted. &ldquo;The weight of the traveling-bag must
      be agony. Let me support the valise until we get back a few yards. Then
      you must lie down until we can get it cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it have to be cut off?&rdquo; I asked as calmly as possible. There were
      red-hot stabs of agony clear to my neck, but we were moving slowly away
      from the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, with dumfounding coolness. &ldquo;If I had a knife I could
      do it myself. You might sit here and lean against this fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By that time my returning faculties had realized that she was going to cut
      off the satchel, not the arm. The dizziness was leaving and I was
      gradually becoming myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you pull, it might come,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;And with that weight gone, I
      think I will cease to be five feet eleven inches of baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried gently to loosen the handle, but it would not move, and at last,
      with great drops of cold perspiration over me, I had to give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I can't stand it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But there's a knife somewhere
      around these clothes, and if I can find it, perhaps you can cut the
      leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I gave her the knife she turned it over, examining it with a peculiar
      expression, bewilderment rather than surprise. But she said nothing. She
      set to work deftly, and in a few minutes the bag dropped free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's better,&rdquo; I declared, sitting up. &ldquo;Now, if you can pin my sleeve to
      my coat, it will support the arm so we can get away from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pin might give,&rdquo; she objected, &ldquo;and the jerk would be terrible.&rdquo; She
      looked around, puzzled; then she got up, coming back in a minute with a
      draggled, partly scorched sheet. This she tore into a large square, and
      after she had folded it, she slipped it under the broken arm and tied it
      securely at the back of my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relief was immediate, and, picking up the sealskin bag, I walked
      slowly beside her, away from the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act was over: the curtain fallen. The scene was &ldquo;struck.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE HALCYON BREAKFAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were still dazed, I think, for we wandered like two troubled children,
      our one idea at first to get as far away as we could from the horror
      behind us. We were both bareheaded, grimy, pallid through the grit. Now
      and then we met little groups of country folk hurrying to the track: they
      stared at us curiously, and some wished to question us. But we hurried
      past them; we had put the wreck behind us. That way lay madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once the girl turned and looked behind her. The wreck was hidden, but
      the smoke cloud hung heavy and dense. For the first time I remembered that
      my companion had not been alone on the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quiet here,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;If you will sit down on the bank I will
      go back and make some inquiries. I've been criminally thoughtless. Your
      traveling companion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted me, and something of her splendid poise was gone. &ldquo;Please
      don't go back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am afraid it would be of no use. And I don't
      want to be left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heaven knows I did not want her to be alone. I was more than content to
      walk along beside her aimlessly, for any length of time. Gradually, as she
      lost the exaltation of the moment, I was gaining my normal condition of
      mind. I was beginning to realize that I had lacked the morning grace of a
      shave, that I looked like some lost hope of yesterday, and that my left
      shoe pinched outrageously. A man does not rise triumphant above such
      handicaps. The girl, for all her disordered hair and the crumpled linen of
      her waist, in spite of her missing hat and the small gold bag that hung
      forlornly from a broken chain, looked exceedingly lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't leave you alone,&rdquo; I said manfully, and we stumbled on
      together. Thus far we had seen nobody from the wreck, but well up the lane
      we came across the tall dark woman who had occupied lower eleven. She was
      half crouching beside the road, her black hair about her shoulders, and an
      ugly bruise over her eye. She did not seem to know us, and refused to
      accompany us. We left her there at last, babbling incoherently and rolling
      in her hands a dozen pebbles she had gathered in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shuddered as we went on. Once she turned and glanced at my
      bandage. &ldquo;Does it hurt very much?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's growing rather numb. But it might be worse,&rdquo; I answered
      mendaciously. If anything in this world could be worse, I had never
      experienced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we trudged on bareheaded under the summer sun, growing parched and
      dusty and weary, doggedly leaving behind us the pillar of smoke. I thought
      I knew of a trolley line somewhere in the direction we were going, or
      perhaps we could find a horse and trap to take us into Baltimore. The girl
      smiled when I suggested it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will create a sensation, won't we?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Isn't it queer&mdash;or
      perhaps it's my state of mind&mdash;but I keep wishing for a pair of
      gloves, when I haven't even a hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the main road we sat down for a moment, and her hair,
      which had been coming loose for some time, fell over her shoulders in
      little waves that were most alluring. It seemed a pity to twist it up
      again, but when I suggested this, cautiously, she said it was troublesome
      and got in her eyes when it was loose. So she gathered it up, while I held
      a row of little shell combs and pins, and when it was done it was vastly
      becoming, too. Funny about hair: a man never knows he has it until he
      begins to lose it, but it's different with a girl. Something of the
      unconventional situation began to dawn on her as she put in the last
      hair-pin and patted some stray locks to place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not told you my name,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;I forgot that because I
      know who you are, you know nothing about me. I am Alison West, and my home
      is in Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was it! This was the girl of the photograph on John Gilmore's
      bedside table. The girl McKnight expected to see in Richmond the next day,
      Sunday! She was on her way back to meet him! Well, what difference did it
      make, anyhow? We had been thrown together by the merest chance. In an hour
      or two at the most we would be back in civilization and she would recall
      me, if she remembered me at all, as an unshaven creature in a red cravat
      and tan shoes, with a soiled Pullman sheet tied around my neck. I drew a
      deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a twinge,&rdquo; I said, when she glanced up quickly. &ldquo;It's very good of
      you to let me know, Miss West. I have been hearing delightful things about
      you for three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Richey McKnight?&rdquo; She was frankly curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. From Richey McKnight,&rdquo; I assented. Was it any wonder McKnight was
      crazy about her? I dug my heels into the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been visiting near Cresson, in the mountains,&rdquo; Miss West was
      saying. &ldquo;The person you mentioned, Mrs. Curtis, was my hostess. We&mdash;we
      were on our way to Washington together.&rdquo; She spoke slowly, as if she
      wished to give the minimum of explanation. Across her face had come again
      the baffling expression of perplexity and trouble I had seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were on your way home, I suppose? Richey spoke about seeing you,&rdquo; I
      floundered, finding it necessary to say something. She looked at me with
      level, direct eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned quietly. &ldquo;I did not intend to go home. I&mdash;well, it
      doesn't matter; I am going home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman in a calico dress, with two children, each an exact duplicate of
      the other, had come quickly down the road. She took in the situation at a
      glance, and was explosively hospitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you'll take the first road to the left
      over there, and turn in at the second pigsty, you will find breakfast on
      the table and a coffee-pot on the stove. And there's plenty of soap and
      water, too. Don't say one word. There isn't a soul there to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We accepted the invitation and she hurried on toward the excitement and
      the railroad. I got up carefully and helped Miss West to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the second pigsty to the left,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;we will find the
      breakfast I promised you seven eternities ago. Forward to the pigsty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We said very little for the remainder of that walk. I had almost reached
      the limit of endurance: with every step the broken ends of the bone grated
      together. We found the farm-house without difficulty, and I remember
      wondering if I could hold out to the end of the old stone walk that led
      between hedges to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allah be praised,&rdquo; I said with all the voice I could muster. &ldquo;Behold the
      coffee-pot!&rdquo; And then I put down the grip and folded up like a jack-knife
      on the porch floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came around something hot was trickling down my neck, and a
      despairing voice was saying, &ldquo;Oh, I don't seem to be able to pour it into
      your mouth. Please open your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want it in my eyes,&rdquo; I replied dreamily. &ldquo;I haven't any idea
      what came over me. It was the shoes, I think: the left one is a red-hot
      torture.&rdquo; I was sitting by that time and looking across into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before or since have I fainted, but I would do it joyfully, a dozen
      times a day, if I could waken again to the blissful touch of soft fingers
      on my face, the hot ecstasy of coffee spilled by those fingers down my
      neck. There was a thrill in every tone of her voice that morning. Before
      long my loyalty to McKnight would step between me and the girl he loved:
      life would develop new complexities. In those early hours after the wreck,
      full of pain as they were, there was nothing of the suspicion and distrust
      that came later. Shorn of our gauds and baubles, we were primitive man and
      woman, together: our world for the hour was the deserted farm-house, the
      slope of wheat-field that led to the road, the woodland lot, the pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      We breakfasted together across the homely table. Our cheerfulness, at
      first sheer reaction, became less forced as we ate great slices of bread
      from the granny oven back of the house, and drank hot fluid that smelled
      like coffee and tasted like nothing that I have ever swallowed. We found
      cream in stone jars, sunk deep in the chill water of the spring house. And
      there were eggs, great yellow-brown ones,&mdash;a basket of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, like two children awakened from a nightmare, we chattered over our
      food: we hunted mutual friends, we laughed together at my feeble
      witticisms, but we put the horror behind us resolutely. After all, it was
      the hat with the green ribbons that brought back the strangeness of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All along I had had the impression that Alison West was deliberately
      putting out of her mind something that obtruded now and then. It brought
      with it a return of the puzzled expression that I had surprised early in
      the day, before the wreck. I caught it once, when, breakfast over, she was
      tightening the sling that held the broken arm. I had prolonged the morning
      meal as much as I could, but when the wooden clock with the pink roses on
      the dial pointed to half after ten, and the mother with the duplicate
      youngsters had not come back, Miss West made the move I had dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are to get into Baltimore at all we must start,&rdquo; she said, rising.
      &ldquo;You ought to see a doctor as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; I said warningly. &ldquo;Don't mention the arm, please; it is asleep
      now. You may rouse it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only had a hat,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;It wouldn't need to be much of one,
      but&mdash;&rdquo; She gave a little cry and darted to the corner. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she
      said triumphantly, &ldquo;the very thing. With the green streamers tied up in a
      bow, like this&mdash;do you suppose the child would mind? I can put five
      dollars or so here&mdash;that would buy a dozen of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a queer affair of straw, that hat, with a round crown and a rim
      that flopped dismally. With a single movement she had turned it up at one
      side and fitted it to her head. Grotesque by itself, when she wore it it
      was a thing of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the lack of head covering had troubled her, for she was elated
      at her find. She left me, scrawling a note of thanks and pinning it with a
      bill to the table-cloth, and ran up-stairs to the mirror and the promised
      soap and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not see her when she came down. I had discovered a bench with a tin
      basin outside the kitchen door, and was washing, in a helpless, one-sided
      way. I felt rather than saw that she was standing in the door-way, and I
      made a final plunge into the basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it possible for a man with only a right hand to wash his left
      ear?&rdquo; I asked from the roller towel. I was distinctly uncomfortable: men
      are more rigidly creatures of convention than women, whether they admit it
      or not. &ldquo;There is so much soap on me still that if I laugh I will blow
      bubbles. Washing with rain-water and home-made soap is like motoring on a
      slippery road. I only struck the high places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, having achieved a brilliant polish with the towel, I looked at the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning against the frame of the door, her face perfectly
      colorless, her breath coming in slow, difficult respirations. The erratic
      hat was pinned to place, but it had slid rakishly to one side. When I
      realized that she was staring, not at me, but past me to the road along
      which we had come, I turned and followed her gaze. There was no one in
      sight: the lane stretched dust white in the sun,&mdash;no moving figure on
      it, no sign of life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. MISS WEST'S REQUEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The surprising change in her held me speechless. All the animation of the
      breakfast table was gone: there was no hint of the response with which,
      before, she had met my nonsensical sallies. She stood there, white-lipped,
      unsmiling, staring down the dusty road. One hand was clenched tight over
      some small object. Her eyes dropped to it from the distant road, and then
      closed, with a quick, indrawn breath. Her color came back slowly. Whatever
      had caused the change, she said nothing. She was anxious to leave at once,
      almost impatient over my deliberate masculine way of getting my things
      together. Afterward I recalled that I had wanted to explore the barn for a
      horse and some sort of a vehicle to take us to the trolley, and that she
      had refused to allow me to look. I remembered many things later that might
      have helped me, and did not. At the time, I was only completely
      bewildered. Save the wreck, the responsibility for which lay between
      Providence and the engineer of the second section, all the events of that
      strange morning were logically connected; they came from one cause, and
      tended unerringly to one end. But the cause was buried, the end not yet in
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until we had left the house well behind did the girl's face relax its
      tense lines. I was watching her more closely than I had realized, for when
      we had gone a little way along the road she turned to me almost
      petulantly. &ldquo;Please don't stare so at me,&rdquo; she said, to my sudden
      confusion. &ldquo;I know the hat is dreadful. Green always makes me look
      ghastly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was the green.&rdquo; I was unaccountably relieved. &ldquo;Do you know, a
      few minutes ago, you looked almost pallid to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at me quickly, but I was gazing ahead. We were out of sight of
      the house, now, and with every step away from it the girl was obviously
      relieved. Whatever she held in her hand, she never glanced at it. But she
      was conscious of it every second. She seemed to come to a decision about
      it while we were still in sight of the gate, for she murmured something
      and turned back alone, going swiftly, her feet stirring up small puffs of
      dust at every step. She fastened something to the gate-post,&mdash;I could
      see the nervous haste with which she worked. When she joined me again it
      was without explanation. But the clenched fingers were free now, and while
      she looked tired and worn, the strain had visibly relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked along slowly in the general direction of the suburban trolley
      line. Once a man with an empty wagon offered us a lift, but after a glance
      at the springless vehicle I declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ends of the bone think they are castanets as it is,&rdquo; I explained.
      &ldquo;But the lady&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady, however, declined and we went on together. Once, when the
      trolley line was in sight, she got a pebble in her low shoe, and we sat
      down under a tree until she found the cause of the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know what I should have done without you,&rdquo; I blundered.
      &ldquo;Moral support and&mdash;and all that. Do you know, my first conscious
      thought after the wreck was of relief that you had not been hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting beside me, where a big chestnut tree shaded the road, and
      I surprised a look of misery on her face that certainly my words had not
      been meant to produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my first thought,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;was regret that I&mdash;that I
      hadn't been obliterated, blown out like a candle. Please don't look like
      that! I am only talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her lips were trembling, and because the little shams of society are
      forgotten at times like this, I leaned over and patted her hand lightly,
      where it rested on the grass beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not say those things,&rdquo; I expostulated. &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, your
      friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no friends on the train.&rdquo; Her voice was hard again, her tone final.
      She drew her hand from under mine, not quickly, but decisively. A car was
      in sight, coming toward us. The steel finger of civilization, of
      propriety, of visiting cards and formal introductions was beckoning us in.
      Miss West put on her shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We said little on the car. The few passengers stared at us frankly, and
      discussed the wreck, emphasizing its horrors. The girl did not seem to
      hear. Once she turned to me with the quick, unexpected movement that was
      one of her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish my mother to know I was in the accident,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will
      you please not tell Richey about having met me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave my promise, of course. Again, when we were almost into Baltimore,
      she asked to examine the gun-metal cigarette case, and sat silent with it
      in her hands, while I told of the early morning's events on the Ontario.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; I finished, &ldquo;this grip, everything I have on, belongs to a
      fellow named Sullivan. He probably left the train before the wreck,&mdash;perhaps
      just after the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;you think he committed the&mdash;the crime?&rdquo; Her eyes were
      on the cigarette case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A man doesn't jump off a Pullman car in the middle
      of the night in another man's clothes, unless he is trying to get away
      from something. Besides the dirk, there were the stains that you saw.
      Why, I have the murdered man's pocket-book in this valise at my feet. What
      does that look like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I colored when I saw the ghost of a smile hovering around the corners of
      her mouth. &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; I finished, &ldquo;if you care to believe that I am
      innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sustaining chain of her small gold bag gave way just then. She did not
      notice it. I picked it up and slid the trinket into my pocket for
      safekeeping, where I promptly forgot it. Afterwards I wished I had let it
      lie unnoticed on the floor of that dirty little suburban car, and even
      now, when I see a woman carelessly dangling a similar feminine trinket, I
      shudder involuntarily: there comes back to me the memory of a girl's
      puzzled eyes under the brim of a flopping hat, the haunting suspicion of
      the sleepless nights that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then I was determined that my companion should not stray back to the
      wreck, and to that end I was determinedly facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that it is Sunday?&rdquo; she asked suddenly, &ldquo;and that we are
      actually ragged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;All Baltimore is divided on Sunday into
      three parts, those who rise up and go to church, those who rise up and
      read the newspapers, and those who don't rise up. The first are somewhere
      between the creed and the sermon, and we need not worry about the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You treat me like a child,&rdquo; she said almost pettishly. &ldquo;Don't try so hard
      to be cheerful. It&mdash;it is almost ghastly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that I subsided like a pricked balloon, and the remainder of the
      ride was made in silence. The information that she would go to friends in
      the city was a shock: it meant an earlier separation than I had planned
      for. But my arm was beginning again. In putting her into a cab I struck it
      and gritted my teeth with the pain. It was probably for that reason that I
      forgot the gold bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward and held out her hand. &ldquo;I may not have another chance
      to thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I think I would better not try, anyhow. I
      cannot tell you how grateful I am.&rdquo; I muttered something about the
      gratitude being mine: owing to the knock I was seeing two cabs, and two
      girls were holding out two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; they were both saying, &ldquo;you have never met me, Mr. Blakeley.
      And&mdash;if you ever hear anything about me&mdash;that is not&mdash;pleasant,
      I want you to think the best you can of me. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two girls were one now, with little flashes of white light playing all
      around. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm afraid that I shall think too well for my own good,&rdquo;
       I said unsteadily. And the cab drove on.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE NAME WAS SULLIVAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had my arm done up temporarily in Baltimore and took the next train
      home. I was pretty far gone when I stumbled out of a cab almost into the
      scandalized arms of Mrs. Klopton. In fifteen minutes I was in bed, with
      that good woman piling on blankets and blistering me in unprotected places
      with hot-water bottles. And in an hour I had a whiff of chloroform and
      Doctor Williams had set the broken bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped asleep then, waking in the late twilight to a realization that I
      was at home again, without the papers that meant conviction for Andy
      Bronson, with a charge of murder hanging over my head, and with something
      more than an impression of the girl my best friend was in love with, a
      girl moreover who was almost as great an enigma as the crime itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm no hand at guessing riddles,&rdquo; I groaned half aloud. Mrs. Klopton
      came over promptly and put a cold cloth on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Euphemia,&rdquo; she said to some one outside the door, &ldquo;telephone the doctor
      that he is still rambling, but that he has switched from green ribbons to
      riddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing the matter with me, Mrs. Klopton,&rdquo; I rebelled. &ldquo;I was
      only thinking out loud. Confound that cloth: it's trickling all over me!&rdquo;
       I gave it a fling, and heard it land with a soggy thud on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking out loud is delirium,&rdquo; Mrs. Klopton said imperturbably. &ldquo;A fresh
      cloth, Euphemia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time she held it on with a firm pressure that I was too weak to
      resist. I expostulated feebly that I was drowning, which she also laid to
      my mental exaltation, and then I finally dropped into a damp sleep. It was
      probably midnight when I roused again. I had been dreaming of the wreck,
      and it was inexpressibly comforting to feel the stability of my bed, and
      to realize the equal stability of Mrs. Klopton, who sat, fully attired, by
      the night light, reading Science and Health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that book say anything about opening the windows on a hot night?&rdquo; I
      suggested, when I had got my bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put it down immediately and came over to me. If there is one time when
      Mrs. Klopton is chastened&mdash;and it is the only time&mdash;it is when
      she reads Science and Health. &ldquo;I don't like to open the shutters, Mr.
      Lawrence,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Not since the night you went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, pressed further, she refused to explain. &ldquo;The doctor said you were
      not to be excited,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Here's your beef tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a drop until you tell me,&rdquo; I said firmly. &ldquo;Besides, you know very
      well there's nothing the matter with me. This arm of mine is only a false
      belief.&rdquo; I sat up gingerly. &ldquo;Now&mdash;why don't you open that window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton succumbed. &ldquo;Because there are queer goings-on in that house
      next door,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you will take the beef tea, Mr. Lawrence, I will
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queer goings-on, however, proved to be slightly disappointing. It
      seemed that after I left on Friday night, a light was seen flitting
      fitfully through the empty house next door. Euphemia had seen it first and
      called Mrs. Klopton. Together they had watched it breathlessly until it
      disappeared on the lower floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have been a writer of ghost stories,&rdquo; I said, giving my
      pillows a thump. &ldquo;And so it was fitting flitfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what it was doing,&rdquo; she reiterated. &ldquo;Fitting flitfully&mdash;I
      mean flitting fitfully&mdash;how you do throw me out, Mr. Lawrence! And
      what's more, it came again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, Mrs. Klopton,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;ghosts are like lightning; they
      never strike twice in the same night. That is only worth half a cup of
      beef tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may ask Euphemia,&rdquo; she retorted with dignity. &ldquo;Not more than an hour
      after, there was a light there again. We saw it through the chinks of the
      shutters. Only&mdash;this time it began at the lower floor and climbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You oughtn't to tell ghost stories at night,&rdquo; came McKnight's voice from
      the doorway. &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Klopton, I'm amazed at you. You old duffer!
      I've got you to thank for the worst day of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton gulped. Then realizing that the &ldquo;old duffer&rdquo; was meant for
      me, she took her empty cup and went out muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pirate's crazy about me, isn't she?&rdquo; McKnight said to the closing
      door. Then he swung around and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I've been laying you out all day, lilies on the
      door-bell, black gloves, everything. If you had had the sense of a
      mosquito in a snow-storm, you would have telephoned me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never even thought of it.&rdquo; I was filled with remorse. &ldquo;Upon my word,
      Rich, I hadn't an idea beyond getting away from that place. If you had
      seen what I saw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight stopped me. &ldquo;Seen it! Why, you lunatic, I've been digging for you
      all day in the ruins! I've lunched and dined on horrors. Give me something
      to rinse them down, Lollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had fished the key of the cellarette from its hiding-place in my shoe
      bag and was mixing himself what he called a Bernard Shaw&mdash;a
      foundation of brandy and soda, with a little of everything else in sight
      to give it snap. Now that I saw him clearly, he looked weary and grimy. I
      hated to tell him what I knew he was waiting to hear, but there was no use
      wading in by inches. I ducked and got it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notes are gone, Rich,&rdquo; I said, as quietly as I could. In spite of
      himself his face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;of course I expected it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But&mdash;Mrs. Klopton said
      over the telephone that you had brought home a grip and I hoped&mdash;well,
      Lord knows we ought not to complain. You're here, damaged, but here.&rdquo; He
      lifted his glass. &ldquo;Happy days, old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will give me that black bottle and a teaspoon, I'll drink that in
      arnica, or whatever the stuff is; Rich,&mdash;the notes were gone before
      the wreck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled and stared at me, the bottle in his hand. &ldquo;Lost, strayed or
      stolen?&rdquo; he queried with forced lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen, although I believe the theft was incidental to something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton came in at that moment, with an eggnog in her hand. She
      glanced at the clock, and, without addressing any one in particular, she
      intimated that it was time for self-respecting folks to be at home in bed.
      McKnight, who could never resist a fling at her back, spoke to me in a
      stage whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she talking still? or again?&rdquo; he asked, just before the door closed.
      There was a second's indecision with the knob, then, judging discretion
      the better part, Mrs. Klopton went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; McKnight said, settling himself in a chair beside the bed,
      &ldquo;spit it out. Not the wreck&mdash;I know all I want about that. But the
      theft. I can tell you beforehand that it was a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had crawled painfully out of bed, and was in the act of pouring the
      egg-nog down the pipe of the washstand. I paused, with the glass in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; I repeated, startled. &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know the first principles of a good detective yarn,&rdquo; he said
      scornfully. &ldquo;Of course, it was the woman in the empty house next door. You
      said it was brass pipes, you will remember. Well&mdash;on with the dance:
      let joy be unconfined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I told the story; I had told it so many times that day that I did it
      automatically. And I told about the girl with the bronze hair, and my
      suspicions. But I did not mention Alison West. McKnight listened to the
      end without interruption. When I had finished he drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's something of a mess, isn't it? If you can only
      prove your mild and child-like disposition, they couldn't hold you for the
      murder&mdash;which is a regular ten-twent-thirt crime, anyhow. But the
      notes&mdash;that's different. They are not burned, anyhow. Your man wasn't
      on the train&mdash;therefore, he wasn't in the wreck. If he didn't know
      what he was taking, as you seem to think, he probably reads the papers,
      and unless he is a fathead, he's awake by this time to what he's got.
      He'll try to sell them to Bronson, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to us,&rdquo; I put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We said nothing for a few minutes. McKnight smoked a cigarette and stared
      at a photograph of Candida over the mantel. Candida is the best pony for a
      heavy mount in seven states.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't go to Richmond,&rdquo; he observed finally. The remark followed my own
      thoughts so closely that I started. &ldquo;Miss West is not home yet from Seal
      Harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving no response, he lapsed again into thoughtful silence. Mrs.
      Klopton came in just as the clock struck one, and made preparation for the
      night by putting a large gaudy comfortable into an arm-chair in the
      dressing-room, with a smaller, stiff-backed chair for her feet. She was
      wonderfully attired in a dressing-gown that was reminiscent, in parts, of
      all the ones she had given me for a half dozen Christmases, and she had a
      purple veil wrapped around her head, to hide Heaven knows what deficiency.
      She examined the empty egg-nog glass, inquired what the evening paper had
      said about the weather, and then stalked into the dressing-room, and
      prepared, with much ostentatious creaking, to sit up all night.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
We fell silent again, while McKnight traced a rough outline of the
berths on the white table-cover, and puzzled it out slowly. It was
something like this:
            ____________________________________

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he changed the tags on seven and nine, so that when you went
      back to bed you thought you were crawling into nine, when it was really
      seven, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably-yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then toward morning, when everybody was asleep, your theory is that he
      changed the numbers again and left the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't think of anything else,&rdquo; I replied wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove, what a game of bridge that fellow would play! It was like finessing
      an eight-spot and winning out. They would scarcely have doubted your story
      had the tags been reversed in the morning. He certainly left you in a bad
      way. Not a jury in the country would stand out against the stains, the
      stiletto, and the murdered man's pocket-book in your possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think Sullivan did it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said McKnight confidently. &ldquo;Unless you did it in your sleep.
      Look at the stains on his pillow, and the dirk stuck into it. And didn't
      he have the man Harrington's pocket-book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did he go off without the money?&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;And where does
      the bronze-haired girl come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; McKnight retorted flippantly. &ldquo;Inflammation of the
      imagination on your part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is the piece of telegram. It said lower ten, car seven. It's
      extremely likely that she had it. That telegram was about me, Richey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm getting a headache,&rdquo; he said, putting out his cigarette against the
      sole of his shoe. &ldquo;All I'm certain of just now is that if there hadn't
      been a wreck, by this time you'd be sitting in an eight by ten cell, and
      feeling like the rhyme for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen to this,&rdquo; I contended, as he picked up his hat, &ldquo;this fellow
      Sullivan is a fugitive, and he's a lot more likely to make advances to
      Bronson than to us. We could have the case continued, release Bronson on
      bail and set a watch on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my watch,&rdquo; McKnight protested. &ldquo;It's a family heirloom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better go home,&rdquo; I said firmly. &ldquo;Go home and go to bed. You're
      sleepy. You can have Sullivan's red necktie to dream over if you think it
      will help any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton's voice came drowsily from the next room, punctuated by a
      yawn. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you,&rdquo; she called, with the suspicious lisp
      which characterizes her at night, &ldquo;somebody called up about noon, Mr.
      Lawrence. It was long distance, and he said he would call again. The name
      was&rdquo;&mdash;she yawned&mdash;&ldquo;Sullivan.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. THE GOLD BAG
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have always smiled at those cases of spontaneous combustion which, like
      fusing the component parts of a seidlitz powder, unite two people in a
      bubbling and ephemeral ecstasy. But surely there is possible, with but a
      single meeting, an attraction so great, a community of mind and interest
      so strong, that between that first meeting and the next the bond may grow
      into something stronger. This is especially true, I fancy, of people with
      temperament, the modern substitute for imagination. It is a nice question
      whether lovers begin to love when they are together, or when they are
      apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that I followed any such line of reasoning at the time. I would not
      even admit my folly to myself. But during the restless hours of that first
      night after the accident, when my back ached with lying on it, and any
      other position was torture, I found my thoughts constantly going back to
      Alison West. I dropped into a doze, to dream of touching her fingers again
      to comfort her, and awoke to find I had patted a teaspoonful of medicine
      out of Mrs. Klopton's indignant hand. What was it McKnight had said about
      making an egregious ass of myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      And that brought me back to Richey, and I fancy I groaned. There is no use
      expatiating on the friendship between two men who have gone together
      through college, have quarreled and made it up, fussed together over
      politics and debated creeds for years: men don't need to be told, and
      women can not understand. Nevertheless, I groaned. If it had been any one
      but Rich!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things were mine, however, and I would hold them: the halcyon
      breakfast, the queer hat, the pebble in her small shoe, the gold bag with
      the broken chain&mdash;the bag! Why, it was in my pocket at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up painfully and found my coat. Yes, there was the purse, bulging
      with an opulent suggestion of wealth inside. I went back to bed again,
      somewhat dizzy, between effort and the touch of the trinket, so lately
      hers. I held it up by its broken chain and gloated over it. By careful
      attention to orders, I ought to be out in a day or so. Then&mdash;I could
      return it to her. I really ought to do that: it was valuable, and I
      wouldn't care to trust it to the mail. I could run down to Richmond, and
      see her once&mdash;there was no disloyalty to Rich in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no intention of opening the little bag. I put it under my pillow&mdash;which
      was my reason for refusing to have the linen slips changed, to Mrs.
      Klopton's dismay. And sometimes during the morning, while I lay under a
      virgin field of white, ornamented with strange flowers, my cigarettes
      hidden beyond discovery, and Science and Health on a table by my elbow, as
      if by the merest accident, I slid my hand under my pillow and touched it
      reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight came in about eleven. I heard his car at the curb, followed
      almost immediately by his slam at the front door, and his usual clamor on
      the stairs. He had a bottle under his arm, rightly surmising that I had
      been forbidden stimulant, and a large box of cigarettes in his pocket,
      suspecting my deprivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;How did you sleep after keeping me up half
      the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I slid my hand around: the purse was well covered. &ldquo;Have it now, or wait
      till I get the cork out?&rdquo; he rattled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want anything,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't be so darned
      cheerful, Richey.&rdquo; He stopped whistling to stare at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am saddest when I sing!'&rdquo; he quoted unctuously. &ldquo;It's pure reaction,
      Lollie. Yesterday the sky was low: I was digging for my best friend.
      To-day&mdash;he lies before me, his peevish self. Yesterday I thought the
      notes were burned: to-day&mdash;I look forward to a good cross-country
      chase, and with luck we will draw.&rdquo; His voice changed suddenly. &ldquo;Yesterday&mdash;she
      was in Seal Harbor. To-day&mdash;she is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here in Washington?&rdquo; I asked, as naturally as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Going to stay a week or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, I had a little hen and she had a wooden leg
     And nearly every morning she used to lay an egg&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stop that racket, Rich! It's the real thing this time, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;She's the best little chicken that we have on the farm
     And another little drink won't do us any harm&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      he finished, twisting out the corkscrew. Then he came over and sat down on
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said judicially, &ldquo;since you drag it from me, I think perhaps it
      is. You&mdash;you're such a confirmed woman-hater that I hardly knew how
      you would take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I denied testily. &ldquo;Because a man reaches the age of
      thirty without making maudlin love to every&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've taken to long country rides,&rdquo; he went on reflectively, without
      listening to me, &ldquo;and yesterday I ran over a sheep; nearly went into the
      ditch. But there's a Providence that watches over fools and lovers, and
      just now I know darned well that I'm one, and I have a sneaking idea I'm
      both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both,&rdquo; I said with disgust. &ldquo;If you can be rational for one
      moment, I wish you would tell me why that man Sullivan called me over the
      telephone yesterday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably hadn't yet discovered the Bronson notes&mdash;providing you hold
      to your theory that the theft was incidental to the murder. May have
      wanted his own clothes again, or to thank you for yours. Search me: I
      can't think of anything else.&rdquo; The doctor came in just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said before, I think a lot of my doctor&mdash;when I am ill. He is a
      young man, with an air of breezy self-confidence and good humor. He looked
      directly past the bottle, which is a very valuable accomplishment, and
      shook hands with McKnight until I could put the cigarettes under the
      bedclothes. He had interdicted tobacco. Then he sat down beside the bed
      and felt around the bandages with hands as gentle as a baby's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good shape,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How did you sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, occasionally,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I would like to sit up, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. Take a rest while you have an excuse for it. I wish to thunder
      I could stay in bed for a day or so. I was up all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a drink,&rdquo; McKnight said, pushing over the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twins!&rdquo; The doctor grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have two drinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the medical man refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't even wear a champagne-colored necktie during business hours,&rdquo;
       he explained. &ldquo;By the way, I had another case from your accident, Mr.
      Blakeley, late yesterday afternoon. Under the tongue, please.&rdquo; He stuck a
      thermometer in my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a sudden terrible vision of the amateur detective coming to light,
      note-book, cheerful impertinence and incriminating data. &ldquo;A small man?&rdquo; I
      demanded, &ldquo;gray hair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your mouth closed,&rdquo; the doctor said peremptorily. &ldquo;No. A woman, with
      a fractured skull. Beautiful case. Van Kirk was up to his eyes and sent
      for me. Hemorrhage, right-sided paralysis, irregular pupils&mdash;all the
      trimmings. Worked for two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she recover?&rdquo; McKnight put in. He was examining the doctor with a new
      awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lifted her right arm before I left,&rdquo; the doctor finished cheerily,
      &ldquo;so the operation was a success, even if she should die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens,&rdquo; McKnight broke in, &ldquo;and I thought you were just an
      ordinary mortal, like the rest of us! Let me touch you for luck. Was she
      pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and young. Had a wealth of bronze-colored hair. Upon my soul, I
      hated to cut it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight and I exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know her name, doctor?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The nurses said her clothes came from a Pittsburg tailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not conscious, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she may be, to-morrow&mdash;or in a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the thermometer, murmured something about liquid diet,
      avoiding my eye&mdash;Mrs. Klopton was broiling a chop at the time&mdash;and
      took his departure, humming cheerfully as he went down-stairs. McKnight
      looked after him wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove, I wish I had his constitution,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Neither nerves nor
      heart! What a chauffeur he would make!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; I said grimly, &ldquo;that this small matter of the murder is
      going to come up again, and that your uncle will be in the deuce of a fix
      if it does. If that woman is going to die, somebody ought to be around to
      take her deposition. She knows a lot, if she didn't do it herself. I wish
      you would go down to the telephone and get the hospital. Find out her
      name, and if she is conscious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight went under protest. &ldquo;I haven't much time,&rdquo; he said, looking at
      his watch. &ldquo;I'm to meet Mrs. West and Alison at one. I want you to know
      them, Lollie. You would like the mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not the daughter?&rdquo; I inquired. I touched the little gold bag under
      the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said judicially, &ldquo;you've always declared against the immaturity
      and romantic nonsense of very young women&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything of the sort,&rdquo; I retorted furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There is more satisfaction to be had out of a good saddle horse!'&rdquo; he
      quoted me. &ldquo;'More excitement out of a polo pony, and as for the eternal
      matrimonial chase, give me instead a good stubble, a fox, some decent
      hounds and a hunter, and I'll show you the real joys of the chase!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, go down to the telephone, you make my head ache,&rdquo; I
      said savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly know what prompted me to take out the gold purse and look at it.
      It was an imbecile thing to do&mdash;call it impulse, sentimentality, what
      you wish. I brought it out, one eye on the door, for Mrs. Klopton has a
      ready eye and a noiseless shoe. But the house was quiet. Down-stairs
      McKnight was flirting with the telephone central and there was an odor of
      boneset tea in the air. I think Mrs. Klopton was fascinated out of her
      theories by the &ldquo;boneset&rdquo; in connection with the fractured arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, I held up the bag and looked at it. It must have been unfastened,
      for the next instant there was an avalanche on the snowfield of the
      counterpane&mdash;some money, a wisp of a handkerchief, a tiny booklet
      with thin leaves, covered with a powdery substance&mdash;and a necklace. I
      drew myself up slowly and stared at the necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the semi-barbaric affairs that women are wearing now, a
      heavy pendant of gold chains and carved cameos, swung from a thin neck
      chain of the same metal. The necklace was broken: in three places the
      links were pulled apart and the cameos swung loose and partly detached.
      But it was the supporting chain that held my eye and fascinated with its
      sinister suggestion. Three inches of it had been snapped off, and as well
      as I knew anything on earth, I knew that the bit of chain that the amateur
      detective had found, blood-stain and all, belonged just there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was no one I could talk to about it, no one to tell me how
      hideously absurd it was, no one to give me a slap and tell me there are
      tons of fine gold chains made every year, or to point out the long arm of
      coincidence!
    </p>
    <p>
      With my one useful hand I fumbled the things back into the bag and thrust
      it deep out of sight among the pillows. Then I lay back in a cold
      perspiration. What connection had Alison West with this crime? Why had she
      stared so at the gun-metal cigarette case that morning on the train? What
      had alarmed her so at the farm-house? What had she taken back to the gate?
      Why did she wish she had not escaped from the wreck? And last, in Heaven's
      name, how did a part of her necklace become torn off and covered with
      blood?
    </p>
    <p>
      Down-stairs McKnight was still at the telephone, and amusing himself with
      Mrs. Klopton in the interval of waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he come home in a gray suit, when he went away in a blue?&rdquo; he
      repeated. &ldquo;Well, wrecks are queer things, Mrs. Klopton. The suit may have
      turned gray with fright. Or perhaps wrecks do as queer stunts as
      lightning. Friend of mine once was struck by lightning; he and the caddy
      had taken refuge under a tree. After the flash, when they recovered
      consciousness, there was my friend in the caddy's clothes, and the caddy
      in his. And as my friend was a large man and the caddy a very small boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight's story was interrupted by the indignant slam of the dining-room
      door. He was obliged to wait some time, and even his eternal cheerfulness
      was ebbing when he finally got the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Doctor Van Kirk there?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Not there? Well, can you tell me
      how the patient is whom Doctor Williams, from Washington, operated on last
      night? Well, I'm glad of that. Is she conscious? Do you happen to know her
      name? Yes, I'll hold the line.&rdquo; There was a long pause, then McKnight's
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello&mdash;yes. Thank you very much. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came up-stairs, two steps at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, bursting into the room, &ldquo;there may be something in
      your theory, after all. The woman's name&mdash;it may be a coincidence,
      but it's curious&mdash;her name is Sullivan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; I said, sitting up suddenly in bed. &ldquo;She's probably
      a sister of that scoundrel in lower seven, and she was afraid of what he
      might do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll go there some day soon. She's not conscious yet. In the
      meantime, the only thing I can do is to keep an eye, through a detective,
      on the people who try to approach Bronson. We'll have the case continued,
      anyhow, in the hope that the stolen notes will sooner or later turn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound this arm,&rdquo; I said, paying for my energy with some excruciating
      throbs. &ldquo;There's so much to be looked after, and here I am, bandaged,
      splinted, and generally useless. It's a beastly shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget that I am here,&rdquo; said McKnight pompously. &ldquo;And another
      thing, when you feel this way just remember there are two less desirable
      places where you might be. One is jail, and the other is&mdash;&rdquo; He
      strummed on an imaginary harp, with devotional eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But McKnight's light-heartedness jarred on me that morning. I lay and
      frowned under my helplessness. When by chance I touched the little gold
      bag, it seemed to scorch my fingers. Richey, finding me unresponsive, left
      to keep his luncheon engagement with Alison West. As he clattered down the
      stairs, I turned my back to the morning sunshine and abandoned myself to
      misery. By what strain on her frayed nerves was Alison West keeping up, I
      wondered? Under the circumstances, would I dare to return the bag? Knowing
      that I had it, would she hate me for my knowledge? Or had I exaggerated
      the importance of the necklace, and in that case had she forgotten me
      already?
    </p>
    <p>
      But McKnight had not gone, after all. I heard him coming back, his voice
      preceding him, and I groaned with irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Somebody's sent you a lot of flowers. Please hold
      the box, Mrs. Klopton; I'm going out to be run down by an automobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I roused to feeble interest. My brother's wife is punctilious about such
      things; all the new babies in the family have silver rattles, and all the
      sick people flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight pulled up an armful of roses, and held them out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder who they're from?&rdquo; he said, fumbling in the box for a card.
      &ldquo;There's no name&mdash;yes, here's one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held it up and read it with exasperating slowness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Best wishes for an early recovery.
                         A COMPANION IN MISFORTUNE.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you know about that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That's something you
      didn't tell me, Lollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was hardly worth mentioning,&rdquo; I said mendaciously, with my heart
      beating until I could hear it. She had not forgotten, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight took a bud and fastened it in his button-hole. I'm afraid I was
      not especially pleasant about it. They were her roses, and anyhow, they
      were meant for me. Richey left very soon, with an irritating final grin at
      the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, sir woman-hater,&rdquo; he jeered at me from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he wore one of the roses she had sent me, to luncheon with her, and I
      lay back among my pillows and tried to remember that it was his game,
      anyhow, and that I wasn't even drawing cards. To remember that, and to
      forget the broken necklace under my head!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. FADED ROSES
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was in the house for a week. Much of that time I spent in composing and
      destroying letters of thanks to Miss West, and in growling at the doctor.
      McKnight dropped in daily, but he was less cheerful than usual. Now and
      then I caught him eying me as if he had something to say, but whatever it
      was he kept it to himself. Once during the week he went to Baltimore and
      saw the woman in the hospital there. From the description I had little
      difficulty in recognizing the young woman who had been with the murdered
      man in Pittsburg. But she was still unconscious. An elderly aunt had
      appeared, a gaunt person in black, who sat around like a buzzard on a
      fence, according to McKnight, and wept, in a mixed figure, into a damp
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of my imprisonment he stopped in to thrash out a case that
      was coming up in court the next day, and to play a game of double
      solitaire with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who won the ball game?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were licked. Ask me something pleasant. Oh, by the way, Bronson's out
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad I'm not on his bond,&rdquo; I said pessimistically. &ldquo;He'll clear out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he.&rdquo; McKnight pounced on my ace. &ldquo;He's no fool. Don't you suppose he
      knows you took those notes to Pittsburg? The papers were full of it. And
      he knows you escaped with your life and a broken arm from the wreck. What
      do we do next? The Commonwealth continues the case. A deaf man on a dark
      night would know those notes are missing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't play so fast,&rdquo; I remonstrated. &ldquo;I have only one arm to your two.
      Who is trailing Bronson? Did you try to get Johnson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked for him, but he had some work on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The murder's evidently a dead issue,&rdquo; I reflected. &ldquo;No, I'm not joking.
      The wreck destroyed all the evidence. But I'm firmly convinced those notes
      will be offered, either to us or to Bronson very soon. Johnson's a
      blackguard, but he's a good detective. He could make his fortune as a game
      dog. What's he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight put down his cards, and rising, went to the window. As he held
      the curtain back his customary grin looked a little forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Lollie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the last two days he has
      been watching a well-known Washington attorney named Lawrence Blakeley.
      He's across the street now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took a moment for me to grasp what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's ridiculous,&rdquo; I asserted. &ldquo;What would they trail me for? Go over
      and tell Johnson to get out of there, or I'll pot at him with my
      revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him that yourself.&rdquo; McKnight paused and bent forward.
      &ldquo;Hello, here's a visitor; little man with string halt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't see him,&rdquo; I said firmly. &ldquo;I've been bothered enough with
      reporters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We listened together to Mrs. Klopton's expostulating tones in the lower
      hall and the creak of the boards as she came heavily up the stairs. She
      had a piece of paper in her hand torn from a pocket account-book, and on
      it was the name, &ldquo;Mr. Wilson Budd Hotchkiss. Important business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, show him up,&rdquo; I said resignedly. &ldquo;You'd better put those cards
      away, Richey. I fancy it's the rector of the church around the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the door opened to admit a curiously alert little man, adjusting
      his glasses with nervous fingers, my face must have shown my dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the amateur detective of the Ontario!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook hands without enthusiasm. Here was the one survivor of the wrecked
      car who could do me any amount of harm. There was no hope that he had
      forgotten any of the incriminating details. In fact, he held in his hand
      the very note-book which contained them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner was restrained, but it was evident he was highly excited. I
      introduced him to McKnight, who has the imagination I lack, and who placed
      him at once, mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only learned yesterday that you had been&mdash;er&mdash;saved,&rdquo; he said
      rapidly. &ldquo;Terrible accident&mdash;unspeakable. Dream about it all night
      and think about it all day. Broken arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He just wears the splint to be different from other people,&rdquo; McKnight
      drawled lazily. I glared at him: there was nothing to be gained by
      antagonizing the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a fractured humerus, which isn't as funny as it sounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humerus-humorous! Pretty good,&rdquo; he cackled. &ldquo;I must say you keep up your
      spirits pretty well, considering everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have escaped injury,&rdquo; I parried. He was fumbling for
      something in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I escaped,&rdquo; he replied abstractedly. &ldquo;Remarkable thing, too. I
      haven't a doubt I would have broken my neck, but I landed on&mdash;you'll
      never guess what! I landed head first on the very pillow which was under
      inspection at the time of the wreck. You remember, don't you? Where did I
      put that package?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found it finally and opened it on a table, displaying with some
      theatricalism a rectangular piece of muslin and a similar patch of striped
      ticking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recognize it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The stains, you see, and the hole made by
      the dirk. I tried to bring away the entire pillow, but they thought I was
      stealing it, and made me give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richey touched the pieces gingerly. &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you carry
      that around in your pocket! What if you should mistake it for your
      handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hotchkiss was not listening. He stood bent somewhat forward,
      leaning over the table, and fixed me with his ferret-like eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you see the evening papers, Mr. Blakeley?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced to where they lay unopened, and shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have a disagreeable task,&rdquo; he said with evident relish. &ldquo;Of
      course, you had considered the matter of the man Harrington's death
      closed, after the wreck. I did myself. As far as I was concerned, I meant
      to let it remain so. There were no other survivors, at least none that I
      knew of, and in spite of circumstances, there were a number of points in
      your favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I put in with a sarcasm that was lost on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I verified your identity, for instance, as soon as I recovered from the
      shock. Also&mdash;I found on inquiring of your tailor that you invariably
      wore dark clothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight came forward threateningly. &ldquo;Who are you, anyhow?&rdquo; he demanded.
      &ldquo;And how is this any business of yours?&rdquo; Mr. Hotchkiss was entirely
      unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a minor position here,&rdquo; he said, reaching for a visiting card. &ldquo;I
      am a very small patch on the seat of government, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight muttered something about certain offensive designs against the
      said patch and retired grumbling to the window. Our visitor was opening
      the paper with a tremendous expenditure of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is. Listen.&rdquo; He read rapidly aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pittsburg police have sent to Baltimore two detectives who are
      looking up the survivors of the ill-fated Washington Flier. It has
      transpired that Simon Harrington, the Wood Street merchant of that city,
      was not killed in the wreck, but was murdered in his berth the night
      preceding the accident. Shortly before the collision, John Flanders, the
      conductor of the Flier, sent this telegram to the chief of police:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'Body of Simon Harrington found stabbed in his berth, lower ten,
  Ontario, at six-thirty this morning.
                                        JOHN FLANDERS, Conductor.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hoped that the survivors of the wrecked car Ontario will be found,
      to tell what they know of the discovery of the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. John Gilmore, head of the steel company for which Mr. Harrington was
      purchasing agent, has signified his intention of sifting the matter to the
      bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; Hotchkiss concluded, &ldquo;there's trouble brewing. You and I are
      the only survivors of that unfortunate car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not contradict him, but I knew of two others, at least: Alison West,
      and the woman we had left beside the road that morning, babbling
      incoherently, her black hair tumbling over her white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless we can find the man who occupied lower seven,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already tried and failed. To find him would not clear you, of
      course, unless we could establish some connection between him and the
      murdered man. It is the only thing I see, however. I have learned this
      much,&rdquo; Hotchkiss concluded: &ldquo;Lower seven was reserved from Cresson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cresson! Where Alison West and Mrs. Curtis had taken the train!
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight came forward and suddenly held out his hand. &ldquo;Mr. Hotchkiss,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm sorry if I have been offensive. I thought when you came
      in, that, like the Irishman and the government, you were 'forninst' us. If
      you will put those cheerful relics out of sight somewhere, I should be
      glad to have you dine with me at the Incubator.&rdquo; (His name for his
      bachelor apartment.) &ldquo;Compared with Johnson, you are the great original
      protoplasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strength of this was lost on Hotchkiss, but the invitation was clear.
      They went out together, and from my window I watched them get into
      McKnight's car. It was raining, and at the corner the Cannonball skidded.
      Across the street my detective, Johnson, looked after them with his
      crooked smile. As he turned up his collar he saw me, and lifted his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the window and sat down in the growing dusk. So the occupant of
      lower seven had got on the car at Cresson, probably with Alison West and
      her companion. There was some one she cared about enough to shield. I went
      irritably to the door and summoned Mrs. Klopton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may throw out those roses,&rdquo; I said without looking at her. &ldquo;They are
      quite dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been quite dead for three days,&rdquo; she retorted spitefully.
      &ldquo;Euphemia said you threatened to dismiss her if she touched them.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE TRAP-DOOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      By Sunday evening, a week after the wreck, my inaction had goaded me to
      frenzy. The very sight of Johnson across the street or lurking, always
      within sight of the house, kept me constantly exasperated. It was on that
      day that things began to come to a focus, a burning-glass of events that
      seemed to center on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dined alone that evening in no cheerful frame of mind. There had been a
      polo game the day before and I had lent a pony, which is always a bad
      thing to do. And she had wrenched her shoulder, besides helping to lose
      the game. There was no one in town: the temperature was ninety and
      climbing, and my left hand persistently cramped under its bandage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton herself saw me served, my bread buttered and cut in tidbits,
      my meat ready for my fork. She hovered around me maternally, obviously
      trying to cheer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paper says still warmer,&rdquo; she ventured. &ldquo;The thermometer is
      ninety-two now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this coffee is two hundred and fifty,&rdquo; I said, putting down my cup.
      &ldquo;Where is Euphemia? I haven't seen her around, or heard a dish smash all
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Euphemia is in bed,&rdquo; Mrs. Klopton said gravely. &ldquo;Is your meat cut small
      enough, Mr. Lawrence?&rdquo; Mrs. Klopton can throw more mystery into an
      ordinary sentence than any one I know. She can say, &ldquo;Are your sheets damp,
      sir?&rdquo; And I can tell from her tone that the house across the street has
      been robbed, or that my left hand neighbor has appendicitis. So now I
      looked up and asked the question she was waiting for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with Euphemia?&rdquo; I inquired idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened into her bed,&rdquo; Mrs. Klopton said in a stage whisper. &ldquo;She's
      had three hot water bottles and she hasn't done a thing all day but moan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She oughtn't to take hot water bottles,&rdquo; I said in my severest tone. &ldquo;One
      would make me moan. You need not wait, I'll ring if I need anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Klopton sailed to the door, where she stopped and wheeled
      indignantly. &ldquo;I only hope you won't laugh on the wrong side of your face
      some morning, Mr. Lawrence,&rdquo; she declared, with Christian fortitude. &ldquo;But
      I warn you, I am going to have the police watch that house next door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was half inclined to tell her that both it and we were under police
      surveillance at that moment. But I like Mrs. Klopton, in spite of the fact
      that I make her life a torment for her, so I refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, when the paper said it was going to storm, I sent Euphemia to
      the roof to bring the rugs in. Eliza had slipped out, although it was her
      evening in. Euphemia went up to the roof&mdash;it was eleven o'clock&mdash;and
      soon I heard her running down-stairs crying. When she got to my room she
      just folded up on the floor. She said there was a black figure sitting on
      the parapet of the house next door&mdash;the empty house&mdash;and that
      when she appeared it rose and waved long black arms at her and spit like a
      cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had finished my dinner and was lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;If there was any
      one up there, which I doubt, they probably sneezed,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;But if
      you feel uneasy, I'll take a look around the roof to-night before I turn
      in. As far as Euphemia goes, I wouldn't be uneasy about her&mdash;doesn't
      she always have an attack of some sort when Eliza rings in an extra
      evening on her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I made a superficial examination of the window locks that night,
      visiting parts of the house that I had not seen since I bought it. Then I
      went to the roof. Evidently it had not been intended for any purpose save
      to cover the house, for unlike the houses around, there was no staircase.
      A ladder and a trap-door led to it, and it required some nice balancing on
      my part to get up with my useless arm. I made it, however, and found this
      unexplored part of my domain rather attractive. It was cooler than
      down-stairs, and I sat on the brick parapet and smoked my final cigarette.
      The roof of the empty house adjoined mine along the back wing, but
      investigation showed that the trap-door across the low dividing wall was
      bolted underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing out of the ordinary anywhere, and so I assured Mrs.
      Klopton. Needless to say, I did not tell her that I had left the trap-door
      open, to see if it would improve the temperature of the house. I went to
      bed at midnight, merely because there was nothing else to do. I turned on
      the night lamp at the head of my bed, and picked up a volume of Shaw at
      random (it was Arms and the Man, and I remember thinking grimly that I was
      a good bit of a chocolate cream soldier myself), and prepared to go to
      sleep. Shaw always puts me to sleep. I have no apologies to make for what
      occurred that night, and not even an explanation that I am sure of. I did
      a foolish thing under impulse, and I have not been sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something after two when the door-bell rang. It rang quickly,
      twice. I got up drowsily, for the maids and Mrs. Klopton always lock
      themselves beyond reach of the bell at night, and put on a dressing-gown.
      The bell rang again on my way down-stairs. I lit the hall light and opened
      the door. I was wide-awake now, and I saw that it was Johnson. His bald
      head shone in the light&mdash;his crooked mouth was twisted in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens, man,&rdquo; I said irritably. &ldquo;Don't you ever go home and go to
      bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the vestibule door behind him and cavalierly turned out the
      light. Our dialogue was sharp, staccato.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a key to the empty house next door?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Somebody's in
      there, and the latch is caught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The houses are alike. The key to this door may fit. Did you see them go
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There's a light moving up from room to room. I saw something like it
      last night, and I have been watching. The patrolman reported queer doings
      there a week or so ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A light!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you mean that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;Have you a revolver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All kinds in the gun rack,&rdquo; I replied, and going into the den, I came
      back with a Smith and Wesson. &ldquo;I'm not much use,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;with this
      arm, but I'll do what I can. There may be somebody there. The servants
      here have been uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson planned the campaign. He suggested on account of my familiarity
      with the roof, that I go there and cut off escape in that direction. &ldquo;I
      have Robison out there now&mdash;the patrolman on the beat,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;He'll watch below and you above, while I search the house. Be as quiet as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was rather amused. I put on some clothes and felt my way carefully up
      the stairs, the revolver swinging free in my pocket, my hand on the rail.
      At the foot of the ladder I stopped and looked up. Above me there was a
      gray rectangle of sky dotted with stars. It occurred to me that with my
      one serviceable hand holding the ladder, I was hardly in a position to
      defend myself, that I was about to hoist a body that I am rather careful
      of into a danger I couldn't see and wasn't particularly keen about anyhow.
      I don't mind saying that the seconds it took me to scramble up the ladder
      were among the most unpleasant that I recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got to the top, however, without incident. I could see fairly well after
      the darkness of the house beneath, but there was nothing suspicious in
      sight. The roofs, separated by two feet of brick wall, stretched around
      me, unbroken save by an occasional chimney. I went very softly over to the
      other trap, the one belonging to the suspected house. It was closed, but I
      imagined I could hear Johnson's footsteps ascending heavily. Then even
      that was gone. A near-by clock struck three as I stood waiting. I examined
      my revolver then, for the first time, and found it was empty!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been rather skeptical until now. I had had the usual tolerant
      attitude of the man who is summoned from his bed to search for burglars,
      combined with the artificial courage of firearms. With the discovery of my
      empty gun, I felt like a man on the top of a volcano in lively eruption.
      Suddenly I found myself staring incredulously at the trap-door at my feet.
      I had examined it early in the evening and found it bolted. Did I imagine
      it, or had it raised about an inch? Wasn't it moving slowly as I looked?
      No, I am not a hero: I was startled almost into a panic. I had one arm,
      and whoever was raising that trap-door had two. My knees had a queer
      inclination to bend the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's footsteps were distinct enough, but he was evidently far below.
      The trap, raised perhaps two inches now, remained stationary. There was no
      sound from beneath it: once I thought I heard two or three gasping
      respirations: I am not sure they were not my own. I wanted desperately to
      stand on one leg at a time and hold the other up out of focus of a
      possible revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not see the hand appear. There was nothing there, and then it was
      there, clutching the frame of the trap. I did the only thing I could think
      of; I put my foot on it!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a sound from beneath. The next moment I was kneeling and had
      clutched the wrist just above the hand. After a second's struggle, the arm
      was still. With something real to face, I was myself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't move, or I'll stand on the trap and break your arm,&rdquo; I panted. What
      else could I threaten? I couldn't shoot, I couldn't even fight. &ldquo;Johnson!&rdquo;
       I called.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I realized the thing that stayed with me for a month, the thing I
      can not think of even now without a shudder. The hand lay ice cold,
      strangely quiescent. Under my fingers, an artery was beating feebly. The
      wrist was as slender as&mdash;I held the hand to the light. Then I let it
      drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; I muttered, and remained on my knees, staring at the spot
      where the hand had been. It was gone now: there was a faint rustle in the
      darkness below, and then silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held up my own hand in the starlight and stared at a long scratch in the
      palm. &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; I said to myself stupidly. &ldquo;By all that's ridiculous, a
      woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was striking matches below and swearing softly to himself. &ldquo;How
      the devil do you get to the roof?&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I think I've broken my
      nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found the ladder after a short search and stood at the bottom, looking
      up at me. &ldquo;Well, I suppose you haven't seen him?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;There are
      enough darned cubbyholes in this house to hide a patrol wagon load of
      thieves.&rdquo; He lighted a fresh match. &ldquo;Hello, here's another door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the sound of his diminishing footsteps I supposed it was a rear
      staircase. He came up again in ten minutes or so, this time with the
      policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone, all right,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;If you'd been attending to your
      business, Robison, you'd have watched the back door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not twins.&rdquo; Robison was surly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I broke in, as cheerfully as I could, &ldquo;if you are through with
      this jolly little affair, and can get down my ladder without having my
      housekeeper ring the burglar alarm, I have some good Monongahela whisky&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came without a second invitation across the roof, and with them
      safely away from the house I breathed more freely. Down in the den I
      fulfilled my promise, which Johnson drank to the toast, &ldquo;Coming through
      the rye.&rdquo; He examined my gun rack with the eye of a connoisseur, and even
      when he was about to go he cast a loving eye back at the weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever been in the army?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said with a bitterness that he noticed but failed to comprehend.
      &ldquo;I'm a chocolate cream soldier&mdash;you don't read Shaw, I suppose,
      Johnson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him,&rdquo; the detective said indifferently. &ldquo;Well, good night,
      Mr. Blakeley. Much obliged.&rdquo; At the door he hesitated and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you understand, Mr. Blakeley,&rdquo; he said awkwardly, &ldquo;that this&mdash;er&mdash;surveillance
      is all in the day's work. I don't like it, but it's duty. Every man to his
      duty, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometime when you are in an open mood, Johnson,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;you can
      explain why I am being watched at all.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XV. THE CINEMATOGRAPH
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday I went out for the first time. I did not go to the office. I
      wanted to walk. I thought fresh air and exercise would drive away the blue
      devils that had me by the throat. McKnight insisted on a long day in his
      car, but I refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why not,&rdquo; he said sulkily. &ldquo;I can't walk. I haven't walked
      two consecutive blocks in three years. Automobiles have made legs mere
      ornaments&mdash;and some not even that. We could have Johnson out there
      chasing us over the country at five dollars an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can chase us just as well at five miles an hour,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But what
      gets me, McKnight, is why I am under surveillance at all. How do the
      police know I was accused of that thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady who sent the flowers&mdash;she isn't likely to talk, is
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That is, I didn't say it was a lady.&rdquo; I groaned as I tried to get my
      splinted arm into a coat. &ldquo;Anyhow, she didn't tell,&rdquo; I finished with
      conviction, and McKnight laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had rained in the early morning, and Mrs. Klopton predicted more
      showers. In fact, so firm was her belief and so determined her eye that I
      took the umbrella she proffered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We can leave it next door; I have a story to tell
      you, Richey, and it requires proper setting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight was puzzled, but he followed me obediently round to the kitchen
      entrance of the empty house. It was unlocked, as I had expected. While we
      climbed to the upper floor I retailed the events of the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the finest thing I ever heard of,&rdquo; McKnight said, staring up at the
      ladder and the trap. &ldquo;What a vaudeville skit it would make! Only you ought
      not to have put your foot on her hand. They don't do it in the best
      circles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wheeled on him impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand the situation at all, Richey!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;What
      would you say if I tell you it was the hand of a lady? It was covered with
      rings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why, I'd say it was a darned compromising
      situation, and that the less you say of it the better. Look here,
      Lawrence, I think you dreamed it. You've been in the house too much. I
      take it all back: you do need exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She escaped through this door, I suppose,&rdquo; I said as patiently as I
      could. &ldquo;Evidently down the back staircase. We might as well go down that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to the best precedents in these affairs, we should find a glove
      about here,&rdquo; he said as we started down. But he was more impressed than he
      cared to own. He examined the dusty steps carefully, and once, when a bit
      of loose plaster fell just behind him, he started like a nervous woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I don't understand is why you let her go,&rdquo; he said, stopping once,
      puzzled. &ldquo;You're not usually quixotic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get out into the country, Richey,&rdquo; I replied gravely, &ldquo;I am going
      to tell you another story, and if you don't tell me I'm a fool and a
      craven, on the strength of it, you are no friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stumbled through the twilight of the staircase into the blackness of
      the shuttered kitchen. The house had the moldy smell of closed buildings:
      even on that warm September morning it was damp and chilly. As we stepped
      into the sunshine McKnight gave a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we are out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't mind telling you that I have been
      there before. Do you remember the night you left, and, the face at the
      window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you speak of it&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was curious about that thing,&rdquo; he went on, as we started up the
      street, &ldquo;and I went back. The street door was unlocked, and I examined
      every room. I was Mrs. Klopton's ghost that carried a light, and clumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a clean place rubbed on the window opposite your dressing-room.
      Splendid view of an untidy interior. If that house is ever occupied, you'd
      better put stained glass in that window of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we turned the corner I glanced back. Half a block behind us Johnson was
      moving our way slowly. When he saw me he stopped and proceeded with great
      deliberation to light a cigar. By hurrying, however, he caught the car
      that we took, and stood unobtrusively on the rear platform. He looked
      fagged, and absent-mindedly paid our fares, to McKnight's delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will give him a run for his money,&rdquo; he declared, as the car moved
      countryward. &ldquo;Conductor, let us off at the muddiest lane you can find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At one o'clock, after a six-mile ramble, we entered a small country hotel.
      We had seen nothing of Johnson for a half hour. At that time he was a
      quarter of a mile behind us, and losing rapidly. Before we had finished
      our luncheon he staggered into the inn. One of his boots was under his
      arm, and his whole appearance was deplorable. He was coated with mud,
      streaked with perspiration, and he limped as he walked. He chose a table
      not far from us and ordered Scotch. Beyond touching his hat he paid no
      attention to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm just getting my second wind,&rdquo; McKnight declared. &ldquo;How do you feel,
      Mr. Johnson? Six or eight miles more and we'll all enjoy our dinners.&rdquo;
       Johnson put down the glass he had raised to his lips without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, however, that I was like Johnson. I was soft from my week's
      inaction, and I was pretty well done up. McKnight, who was a well spring
      of vitality and high spirits, ordered a strange concoction, made of nearly
      everything in the bar, and sent it over to the detective, but Johnson
      refused it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate that kind of person,&rdquo; McKnight said pettishly. &ldquo;Kind of a fellow
      that thinks you're going to poison his dog if you offer him a bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we got back to the car line, with Johnson a draggled and drooping
      tail to the kite, I was in better spirits. I had told McKnight the story
      of the three hours just after the wreck; I had not named the girl, of
      course; she had my promise of secrecy. But I told him everything else. It
      was a relief to have a fresh mind on it: I had puzzled so much over the
      incident at the farm-house, and the necklace in the gold bag, that I had
      lost perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been interested, but inclined to be amused, until I came to the
      broken chain. Then he had whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are tons of fine gold chains made every year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why in
      the world do you think that the&mdash;er&mdash;smeary piece came from that
      necklace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had looked around. Johnson was far behind, scraping the mud off his feet
      with a piece of stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the short end of the chain in the sealskin bag,&rdquo; I reminded him.
      &ldquo;When I couldn't sleep this morning I thought I would settle it, one way
      or the other. It was hell to go along the way I had been doing. And&mdash;there's
      no doubt about it, Rich. It's the same chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked along in silence until we caught the car back to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;you know the girl, of course, and I don't. But
      if you like her&mdash;and I think myself you're rather hard hit, old man&mdash;I
      wouldn't give a whoop about the chain in the gold purse. It's just one of
      the little coincidences that hang people now and then. And as for last
      night&mdash;if she's the kind of a girl you say she is, and you think she
      had anything to do with that, you&mdash;you're addled, that's all. You can
      depend on it, the lady of the empty house last week is the lady of last
      night. And yet your train acquaintance was in Altoona at that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just before we got off the car, I reverted to the subject again. It was
      never far back in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the&mdash;young lady of the train, Rich,&rdquo; I said, with what I
      suppose was elaborate carelessness, &ldquo;I don't want you to get a wrong
      impression. I am rather unlikely to see her again, but even if I do, I&mdash;I
      believe she is already 'bespoke,' or next thing to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, but as I opened the door with my latch-key he stood
      looking up at me from the pavement with his quizzical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love is like the measles,&rdquo; he orated. &ldquo;The older you get it, the worse
      the attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson did not appear again that day. A small man in a raincoat took his
      place. The next morning I made my initial trip to the office, the raincoat
      still on hand. I had a short conference with Miller, the district
      attorney, at eleven. Bronson was under surveillance, he said, and any
      attempt to sell the notes to him would probably result in their recovery.
      In the meantime, as I knew, the Commonwealth had continued the case, in
      hope of such contingency.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon I left the office and took a veterinarian to see Candida, the
      injured pony. By one o'clock my first day's duties were performed, and a
      long Sahara of hot afternoon stretched ahead. McKnight, always glad to
      escape from the grind, suggested a vaudeville, and in sheer ennui I
      consented. I could neither ride, drive nor golf, and my own company bored
      me to distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coolest place in town these days,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Electric fans, breezy
      songs, airy costumes. And there's Johnson just behind&mdash;the coldest
      proposition in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gravely bought three tickets and presented the detective with one. Then
      we went in. Having lived a normal, busy life, the theater in the afternoon
      is to me about on a par with ice-cream for breakfast. Up on the stage a
      very stout woman in short pink skirts, with a smile that McKnight declared
      looked like a slash in a roll of butter, was singing nasally, with a
      laborious kick at the end of each verse. Johnson, two rows ahead, went to
      sleep. McKnight prodded me with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the first box to the right,&rdquo; he said, in a stage whisper. &ldquo;I want
      you to come over at the end of this act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time I had seen her since I put her in the cab at
      Baltimore. Outwardly I presume I was calm, for no one turned to stare at
      me, but every atom of me cried out at the sight of her. She was leaning,
      bent forward, lips slightly parted, gazing raptly at the Japanese conjurer
      who had replaced what McKnight disrespectfully called the Columns of
      Hercules. Compared with the draggled lady of the farm-house, she was
      radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that first moment there was nothing but joy at the sight of her.
      McKnight's touch on my arm brought me back to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over and meet them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's the cousin Miss West is
      visiting, Mrs. Dallas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I would not go. After he went I sat there alone, painfully conscious
      that I was being pointed out and stared at from the box. The abominable
      Japanese gave way to yet more atrocious performing dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many offers of marriage will the young lady in the box have?&rdquo; The dog
      stopped sagely at 'none,' and then pulled out a card that said eight. Wild
      shouts of glee by the audience. &ldquo;The fools,&rdquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little I glanced over. Mrs. Dallas was talking to McKnight, but
      She was looking straight at me. She was flushed, but more calm than I, and
      she did not bow. I fumbled for my hat, but the next moment I saw that they
      were going, and I sat still. When McKnight came back he was triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've made an engagement for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Dallas asked me to bring
      you to dinner to-night, and I said I knew you would fall all over yourself
      to go. You are requested to bring along the broken arm, and any other
      souvenirs of the wreck that you may possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I declared, struggling against my
      inclination. &ldquo;I can't even tie my necktie, and I have to have my food cut
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; he said easily. &ldquo;I'll send Stogie over to fix you
      up, and Mrs. Dal knows all about the arm. I told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Stogie is his Japanese factotum, so called because he is lean, a
      yellowish brown in color, and because he claims to have been shipped into
      this country in a box.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cinematograph was finishing the program. The house was dark and the
      music had stopped, as it does in the circus just before somebody risks his
      neck at so much a neck in the Dip of Death, or the hundred-foot dive.
      Then, with a sort of shock, I saw on the white curtain the announcement:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         THE NEXT PICTURE
</pre>
    <p>
      IS THE DOOMED WASHINGTON FLIER, TAKEN A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE SCENE OF
      THE WRECK ON THE FATAL MORNING OF SEPTEMBER TENTH. TWO MILES FARTHER ON IT
      MET WITH ALMOST COMPLETE ANNIHILATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess to a return of some of the sickening sensations of the wreck;
      people around me were leaning forward with tense faces. Then the letters
      were gone, and I saw a long level stretch of track, even the broken stone
      between the ties standing out distinctly. Far off under a cloud of smoke a
      small object was rushing toward us and growing larger as it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was on us, a mammoth in size, with huge drivers and a colossal
      tender. The engine leaped aside, as if just in time to save us from
      destruction, with a glimpse of a stooping fireman and a grimy engineer.
      The long train of sleepers followed. From a forward vestibule a porter in
      a white coat waved his hand. The rest of the cars seemed still wrapped in
      slumber. With mixed sensations I saw my own car, Ontario, fly past, and
      then I rose to my feet and gripped McKnight's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the lowest step at the last car, one foot hanging free, was a man. His
      black derby hat was pulled well down to keep it from blowing away, and his
      coat was flying open in the wind. He was swung well out from the car, his
      free hand gripping a small valise, every muscle tense for a jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, that's my man!&rdquo; I said hoarsely, as the audience broke into
      applause. McKnight half rose: in his seat ahead Johnson stifled a yawn and
      turned to eye me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped into my chair limply, and tried to control my excitement. &ldquo;The
      man on the last platform of the train,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He was just about to
      leap; I'll swear that was my bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you see his face?&rdquo; McKnight asked in an undertone. &ldquo;Would you know
      him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. His hat was pulled down and his head was bent I'm going back to find
      out where that picture was taken. They say two miles, but it may have been
      forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience, busy with its wraps, had not noticed. Mrs. Dallas and Alison
      West had gone. In front of us Johnson had dropped his hat and was stooping
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; I motioned to McKnight, and we wheeled into the narrow passage
      beside us, back of the boxes. At the end there was a door leading into the
      wings, and as we went boldly through I turned the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final set was being struck, and no one paid any attention to us.
      Luckily they were similarly indifferent to a banging at the door I had
      locked, a banging which, I judged, signified Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we've broken up his interference,&rdquo; McKnight chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stage hands were hurrying in every direction; pieces of the side wall of
      the last drawing-room menaced us; a switchboard behind us was singing like
      a tea-kettle. Everywhere we stepped we were in somebody's way. At last we
      were across, confronting a man in his shirt sleeves, who by dots and
      dashes of profanity seemed to be directing the chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, wheeling on us. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to ask,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;if you have any idea just where the
      last cinematograph picture was taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken board&mdash;picnickers&mdash;lake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The Washington Flier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at my bandaged arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The announcement says two miles,&rdquo; McKnight put in, &ldquo;but we should like to
      know whether it is railroad miles, automobile miles, or policeman miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I can't tell you,&rdquo; he replied, more civilly. &ldquo;We get those
      pictures by contract. We don't take them ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the company's offices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York.&rdquo; He stepped forward and grasped a super by the shoulder. &ldquo;What
      in blazes are you doing with that gold chair in a kitchen set? Take that
      piece of pink plush there and throw it over a soap box, if you haven't got
      a kitchen chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not realized the extent of the shock, but now I dropped into a chair
      and wiped my forehead. The unexpected glimpse of Alison West, followed
      almost immediately by the revelation of the picture, had left me limp and
      unnerved. McKnight was looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says the moving picture people have an office down-town. We can make
      it if we go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he called a cab, and we started at a gallop. There was no sign of the
      detective. &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; Richey said, &ldquo;I feel lonely without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people at the down-town office of the cinematograph company were very
      obliging. The picture had been taken, they said, at M-, just two miles
      beyond the scene of the wreck. It was not much, but it was something to
      work on. I decided not to go home, but to send McKnight's Jap for my
      clothes, and to dress at the Incubator. I was determined, if possible, to
      make my next day's investigations without Johnson. In the meantime, even
      if it was for the last time, I would see Her that night. I gave Stogie a
      note for Mrs. Klopton, and with my dinner clothes there came back the gold
      bag, wrapped in tissue paper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE SHADOW OF A GIRL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Certain things about the dinner at the Dallas house will always be obscure
      to me. Dallas was something in the Fish Commission, and I remember his
      reeling off fish eggs in billions while we ate our caviar. He had some
      particular stunt he had been urging the government to for years&mdash;something
      about forbidding the establishment of mills and factories on river-banks&mdash;it
      seems they kill the fish, either the smoke, or the noise, or something
      they pour into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dallas was there, I think. Of course, I suppose she must have been;
      and there was a woman in yellow: I took her in to dinner, and I remember
      she loosened my clams for me so I could get them. But the only real person
      at the table was a girl across in white, a sublimated young woman who was
      as brilliant as I was stupid, who never by any chance looked directly at
      me, and who appeared and disappeared across the candles and orchids in a
      sort of halo of radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dinner had progressed from salmon to roast, and the conversation
      had done the same thing&mdash;from fish to scandal&mdash;the yellow gown
      turned to me. &ldquo;We have been awfully good, haven't we, Mr. Blakeley?&rdquo; she
      asked. &ldquo;Although I am crazy to hear, I have not said 'wreck' once. I'm
      sure you must feel like the survivor of Waterloo, or something of the
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want me to tell you about the wreck,&rdquo; I said, glancing across the
      table, &ldquo;I'm sorry to be disappointing, but I don't remember anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fortunate to be able to forget it.&rdquo; It was the first word Miss
      West had spoken directly to me, and it went to my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things I have not forgotten,&rdquo; I said, over the candles. &ldquo;I
      recall coming to myself some time after, and that a girl, a beautiful girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the lady in yellow, leaning forward breathlessly. Miss West was
      staring at me coldly, but, once started, I had to stumble on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That a girl was trying to rouse me, and that she told me I had been on
      fire twice already.&rdquo; A shudder went around the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely that isn't the end of the story,&rdquo; Mrs. Dallas put in
      aggrievedly. &ldquo;Why, that's the most tantalizing thing I ever heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that's all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She went her way and I went mine. If she
      recalls me at all, she probably thinks of me as a weak-kneed individual
      who faints like a woman when everything is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; Mrs. Dallas asserted triumphantly. &ldquo;He fainted, did
      you hear? when everything was over! He hasn't begun to tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would have given a lot by that time if I had not mentioned the girl. But
      McKnight took it up there and carried it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blakeley is a regular geyser,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He never spouts until he reaches
      the boiling point. And by that same token, although he hasn't said much
      about the Lady of the Wreck, I think he is crazy about her. In fact, I am
      sure of it. He thinks he has locked his secret in the caves of his soul,
      but I call you to witness that he has it nailed to his face. Look at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I squirmed miserably and tried to avoid the startled eyes of the girl
      across the table. I wanted to choke McKnight and murder the rest of the
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't fair,&rdquo; I said as coolly as I could. &ldquo;I have my fingers crossed;
      you are five against one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that there was a murder on that very train,&rdquo; broke in the
      lady in yellow. &ldquo;It was a perfect crescendo of horrors, wasn't it? And
      what became of the murdered man, Mr. Blakeley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight had the sense to jump into the conversation and save my reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say good Pittsburgers go to Atlantic City when they die,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;So&mdash;we are reasonably certain the gentleman did not go to the
      seashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meal was over at last, and once in the drawing-room it was clear we
      hung heavy on the hostess' hands. &ldquo;It is so hard to get people for bridge
      in September,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;there is absolutely nobody in town. Six is a
      dreadful number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good poker number,&rdquo; her husband suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter settled itself, however. I was hopeless, save as a dummy; Miss
      West said it was too hot for cards, and went out on a balcony that
      overlooked the Mall. With obvious relief Mrs. Dallas had the card-table
      brought, and I was face to face with the minute I had dreaded and hoped
      for for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it had come, it was more difficult than I had anticipated. I do not
      know if there was a moon, but there was the urban substitute for it&mdash;the
      arc light. It threw the shadow of the balcony railing in long black bars
      against her white gown, and as it swung sometimes her face was in the
      light. I drew a chair close so that I could watch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I said, when she made no effort at speech, &ldquo;that you are a
      much more formidable person to-night, in that gown, than you were the last
      time I saw you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light swung on her face; she was smiling faintly. &ldquo;The hat with the
      green ribbons!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must take it back; I had almost forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not forgotten&mdash;anything.&rdquo; I pulled myself up short. This was
      hardly loyalty to Richey. His voice came through the window just then, and
      perhaps I was wrong, but I thought she raised her head to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this hand,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Regular pianola: you could play it
      with your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a dear, isn't he?&rdquo; Alison said unexpectedly. &ldquo;No matter how
      depressed and downhearted I am, I always cheer up when I see Richey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's more than that,&rdquo; I returned warmly. &ldquo;He is the most honorable fellow
      I know. If he wasn't so much that way, he would have a career before him.
      He wanted to put on the doors of our offices, Blakeley and McKnight, P. B.
      H., which is Poor But Honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From my comparative poverty to the wealth of the girl beside me was a
      single mental leap. From that wealth to the grandfather who was
      responsible for it was another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you know that I had been to Pittsburg to see your grandfather
      when I met you?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; She was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And you remember the alligator bag that I told you was exchanged for
      the one you cut off my arm?&rdquo; She nodded expectantly. &ldquo;Well, in that valise
      were the forged Andy Bronson notes, and Mr. Gilmore's deposition that they
      were forged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was on her feet in an instant. &ldquo;In that bag!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, why
      didn't you tell me that before? Oh, it's so ridiculous, so&mdash;so
      hopeless. Why, I could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly and sat down again. &ldquo;I do not know that I am sorry,
      after all,&rdquo; she said after a pause. &ldquo;Mr. Bronson was a friend of my
      father's. I&mdash;I suppose it was a bad thing for you, losing the
      papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was not a good thing,&rdquo; I conceded. &ldquo;While we are on the subject
      of losing things, do you remember&mdash;do you know that I still have your
      gold purse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply at once. The shadow of a column was over her face, but I
      guessed that she was staring at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it!&rdquo; She almost whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I picked it up in the street car,&rdquo; I said, with a cheerfulness I did not
      feel. &ldquo;It looks like a very opulent little purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why didn't she speak about the necklace? For just a careless word to make
      me sane again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she repeated, horror-stricken. And then I produced the purse and
      held it out on my palm. &ldquo;I should have sent it to you before, I suppose,
      but, as you know, I have been laid up since the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both saw McKnight at the same moment. He had pulled the curtains aside
      and was standing looking out at us. The tableau of give and take was
      unmistakable; the gold purse, her outstretched hand, my own attitude. It
      was over in a second; then he came out and lounged on the balcony railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're mad at me in there,&rdquo; he said airily, &ldquo;so I came out. I suppose
      the reason they call it bridge is because so many people get cross over
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heat broke up the card group soon after, and they all came out for the
      night breeze. I had no more words alone with Alison.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the Incubator for the night. We said almost nothing on the
      way home; there was a constraint between us for the first time that I
      could remember. It was too early for bed, and so we smoked in the
      living-room and tried to talk of trivial things. After a time even those
      failed, and we sat silent. It was McKnight who finally broached the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so she wasn't at Seal Harbor at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where she was, Lollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere near Cresson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was the purse&mdash;her purse&mdash;with the broken necklace in
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was. You understand, don't you, Rich, that, having given her my
      word, I couldn't tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand a lot of things,&rdquo; he said, without bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat for some time and smoked. Then Richey got up and stretched himself.
      &ldquo;I'm off to bed, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Need any help with that game arm of
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him go into his room and lock the door. It was a bad hour for me.
      The first shadow between us, and the shadow of a girl at that.

      CHAPTER XVII. AT THE FARM-HOUSE AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      McKnight is always a sympathizer with the early worm. It was late when he
      appeared. Perhaps, like myself, he had not slept well. But he was
      apparently cheerful enough, and he made a better breakfast than I did. It
      was one o'clock before we got to Baltimore. After a half hour's wait we
      took a local for M-, the station near which the cinematograph picture had
      been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed the scene of the wreck, McKnight with curiosity, I with a
      sickening sense of horror. Back in the fields was the little farm-house
      where Alison West and I had intended getting coffee, and winding away from
      the track, maple trees shading it on each side, was the lane where we had
      stopped to rest, and where I had&mdash;it seemed presumption beyond belief
      now&mdash;where I had tried to comfort her by patting her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got out at M-, a small place with two or three houses and a general
      store. The station was a one-roomed affair, with a railed-off place at the
      end, where a scale, a telegraph instrument and a chair constituted the
      entire furnishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station agent was a young man with a shrewd face. He stopped hammering
      a piece of wood over a hole in the floor to ask where we wanted to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're not going,&rdquo; said McKnight, &ldquo;we're coming. Have a cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent took it with an inquiring glance, first at it and then at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to ask you a few questions,&rdquo; began McKnight, perching himself on
      the railing and kicking the chair forward for me. &ldquo;Or, rather, this
      gentleman does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said the agent, glancing through the window. &ldquo;There's a
      hen in that crate choking herself to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was back in a minute, and took up his position near a sawdust-filled
      box that did duty as a cuspidor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now fire away,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;do you remember the day the Washington
      Flier was wrecked below here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did Jonah remember the whale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you on the platform here when the first section passed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recall seeing a man hanging to the platform of the last car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no one hanging there when she passed here,&rdquo; he said with
      conviction. &ldquo;I watched her out of sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see anything that morning of a man about my size, carrying a
      small grip, and wearing dark clothes and a derby hat?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight was trying to look unconcerned, but I was frankly anxious. It was
      clear that the man had jumped somewhere in the mile of track just beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, I did.&rdquo; The agent cleared his throat. &ldquo;When the smash came the
      operator at MX sent word along the wire, both ways. I got it here, and I
      was pretty near crazy, though I knew it wasn't any fault of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was standing on the track looking down, for I couldn't leave the
      office, when a young fellow with light hair limped up to me and asked me
      what that smoke was over there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's what's left of the Washington Flier,' I said, 'and I guess
      there's souls going up in that smoke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do you mean the first section?' he said, getting kind of
      greenish-yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's what I mean,' I said; 'split to kindling wood because Rafferty,
      on the second section, didn't want to be late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He put his hand out in front of him, and the satchel fell with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My God!' he said, and dropped right on the track in a heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got him into the station and he came around, but he kept on groaning
      something awful. He'd sprained his ankle, and when he got a little better
      I drove him over in Carter's milk wagon to the Carter place, and I reckon
      he stayed there a spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all, is it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all&mdash;or, no, there's something else. About noon that day one
      of the Carter twins came down with a note from him asking me to send a
      long-distance message to some one in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I've forgot the name, but the message was that this fellow&mdash;Sullivan
      was his name&mdash;was at M-, and if the man had escaped from the wreck
      would he come to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't have sent that message to me,&rdquo; I said to McKnight, rather
      crestfallen. &ldquo;He'd have every object in keeping out of my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be reasons,&rdquo; McKnight observed judicially. &ldquo;He might not have
      found the papers then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the name Blakeley?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have been&mdash;I can't say. But the man wasn't there, and there
      was a lot of noise. I couldn't hear well. Then in half an hour down came
      the other twin to say the gentleman was taking on awful and didn't want
      the message sent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Limped down here in about three days and took the noon train for the
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a certainty now that our man, having hurt himself somewhat in
      his jump, had stayed quietly in the farm-house until he was able to
      travel. But, to be positive, we decided to visit the Carter place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave the station agent a five-dollar bill, which he rolled up with a
      couple of others and stuck in his pocket. I turned as we got to a bend in
      the road, and he was looking curiously after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until we had climbed the hill and turned onto the road to the
      Carter place that I realized where we were going. Although we approached
      it from another direction, I knew the farm-house at once. It was the one
      where Alison West and I had breakfasted nine days before. With the new
      restraint between us, I did not tell McKnight. I wondered afterward if he
      had suspected it. I saw him looking hard at the gate-post which had
      figured in one of our mysteries, but he asked no questions. Afterward he
      grew almost taciturn, for him, and let me do most of the talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      We opened the front gate of the Carter place and went slowly up the walk.
      Two ragged youngsters, alike even to freckles and squints, were playing in
      the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your mother around?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the front room. Walk in,&rdquo; they answered in identical tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we got to the porch we heard voices, and stopped. I knocked, but the
      people within, engaged in animated, rather one-sided conversation, did not
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In the front room. Walk in,'&rdquo; quoted McKnight, and did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stuffy farm parlor two people were sitting. One, a pleasant-faced
      woman with a checked apron, rose, somewhat embarrassed, to meet us. She
      did not know me, and I was thankful. But our attention was riveted on a
      little man who was sitting before a table, writing busily. It was
      Hotchkiss!
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up when he saw us, and had the grace to look uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an interesting case,&rdquo; he said nervously, &ldquo;I took the liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said McKnight suddenly, &ldquo;did you make any inquiries at the
      station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I went to the theater last night&mdash;I felt the
      need of a little relaxation&mdash;and the sight of a picture there, a
      cinematograph affair, started a new line of thought. Probably the same
      clue brought you gentlemen. I learned a good bit from the station agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son-of-a-gun,&rdquo; said McKnight. &ldquo;And you paid him, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him five dollars,&rdquo; was the apologetic answer. Mrs. Carter, hearing
      sounds of strife in the yard, went out, and Hotchkiss folded up his
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the identity of the man is established,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What number of
      hat do you wear, Mr. Blakeley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven and a quarter,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's only piling up evidence,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;On the night of
      the murder you wore light gray silk underclothing, with the second button
      of the shirt missing. Your hat had 'L. B.' in gilt letters inside, and
      there was a very minute hole in the toe of one black sock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; McKnight protested. &ldquo;If word gets to Mrs. Klopton that Mr.
      Blakeley was wrecked, or robbed, or whatever it was, with a button missing
      and a hole in one sock, she'll retire to the Old Ladies' Home. I've heard
      her threaten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hotchkiss was without a sense of humor. He regarded McKnight gravely
      and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been up in the room where the man lay while he was unable to get
      away, and there is nothing there. But I found what may be a possible clue
      in the dust heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Carter tells me that in unpacking his grip the other day she took
      out of the coat of the pajamas some pieces of a telegram. As I figure it,
      the pajamas were his own. He probably had them on when he effected the
      exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded assent. All I had retained of my own clothing was the suit of
      pajamas I was wearing and my bath-robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore the telegram was his, not yours. I have pieces here, but some
      are missing. I am not discouraged, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spread out some bits of yellow paper, and we bent over them curiously.
      It was something like this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              Man with p-    Get-
                              Br-
</pre>
    <p>
      We spelled it out slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Hotchkiss announced, &ldquo;I make it something like this: The 'p.-' is
      one of two things, pistol&mdash;you remember the little pearl-handled
      affair belonging to the murdered man&mdash;or it is pocket-book. I am
      inclined to the latter view, as the pocket-book had been disturbed and the
      pistol had not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the piece of paper from the table and scrawled four words on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, rearranging them, &ldquo;it happens, Mr. Hotchkiss, that I found
      one of these pieces of the telegram on the train. I thought it had been
      dropped by some one else, you see, but that's immaterial. Arranged this
      way it almost makes sense. Fill out that 'p.-' with the rest of the word,
      as I imagine it, and it makes 'papers,' and add this scrap and you have:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Man with papers (in) lower ten, car seven. Get (them).'
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight slapped Hotchkiss on the back. &ldquo;You're a trump,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Br- is
      Bronson, of course. It's almost too easy. You see, Mr. Blakeley here
      engaged lower ten, but found it occupied by the man who was later murdered
      there. The man who did the thing was a friend of Bronson's, evidently, and
      in trying to get the papers we have the motive for the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are still some things to be explained.&rdquo; Mr. Hotchkiss wiped his
      glasses and put them on. &ldquo;For one thing, Mr. Blakeley, I am puzzled by
      that bit of chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not glance at McKnight. I felt that the hand, with which I was
      gathering up the bits of torn paper were shaking. It seemed to me that
      this astute little man was going to drag in the girl in spite of me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. A NEW WORLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss jotted down the bits of telegram and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we've done something. We've found where the murderer
      left the train, we know what day he went to Baltimore, and, most important
      of all, we have a motive for the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems the irony of fate,&rdquo; said McKnight, getting up, &ldquo;that a man
      should kill another man for certain papers he is supposed to be carrying,
      find he hasn't got them after all, decide to throw suspicion on another
      man by changing berths and getting out, bag and baggage, and then, by the
      merest fluke of chance, take with him, in the valise he changed for his
      own, the very notes he was after. It was a bit of luck for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; put in Hotchkiss doubtfully, &ldquo;why did he collapse when he
      heard of the wreck? And what about the telephone message the station agent
      sent? You remember they tried to countermand it, and with some
      excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will ask him those questions when we get him,&rdquo; McKnight said. We were
      on the unrailed front porch by that time, and Hotchkiss had put away his
      notebook. The mother of the twins followed us to the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she exclaimed volubly, &ldquo;and to think I was forgetting to tell
      you! I put the young man to bed with a spice poultice on his ankle: my
      mother always was a firm believer in spice poultices. It's wonderful what
      they will do in croup! And then I took the children and went down to see
      the wreck. It was Sunday, and the mister had gone to church; hasn't missed
      a day since he took the pledge nine years ago. And on the way I met two
      people, a man and a woman. They looked half dead, so I sent them right
      here for breakfast and some soap and water. I always say soap is better
      than liquor after a shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss was listening absently: McKnight was whistling under his breath,
      staring down across the field to where a break in the woods showed a half
      dozen telegraph poles, the line of the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been twelve o'clock when we got back; I wanted the children
      to see everything, because it isn't likely they'll ever see another wreck
      like that. Rows of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twelve o'clock,&rdquo; I broke in, &ldquo;and what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man up-stairs was awake,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and hammering at his
      door like all possessed. And it was locked on the outside!&rdquo; She paused to
      enjoy her sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to see that lock,&rdquo; Hotchkiss said promptly, but for some
      reason the woman demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring the key down,&rdquo; she said and disappeared. When she returned
      she held out an ordinary door key of the cheapest variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had to break the lock,&rdquo; she volunteered, &ldquo;and the key didn't turn up
      for two days. Then one of the twins found the turkey gobbler trying to
      swallow it. It has been washed since,&rdquo; she hastened to assure Hotchkiss,
      who showed an inclination to drop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think he locked the door himself and threw the key out of the
      window?&rdquo; the little man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The windows are covered with mosquito netting, nailed on. The mister
      blamed it on the children, and it might have been Obadiah. He's the quiet
      kind, and you never know what he's about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's about to strangle, isn't he,&rdquo; McKnight remarked lazily, &ldquo;or is that
      Obadiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carter picked the boy up and inverted him, talking amiably all the
      time. &ldquo;He's always doing it,&rdquo; she said, giving him a shake. &ldquo;Whenever we
      miss anything we look to see if Obadiah's black in the face.&rdquo; She gave him
      another shake, and the quarter I had given him shot out as if blown from a
      gun. Then we prepared to go back to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where I stood I could look into the cheery farm kitchen, where Alison
      West and I had eaten our al fresco breakfast. I looked at the table with
      mixed emotions, and then, gradually, the meaning of something on it
      penetrated my mind. Still in its papers, evidently just opened, was a hat
      box, and protruding over the edge of the box was a streamer of vivid green
      ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the plea that I wished to ask Mrs. Carter a few more questions, I let
      the others go on. I watched them down the flagstone walk; saw McKnight
      stop and examine the gate-posts and saw, too, the quick glance he threw
      back at the house. Then I turned to Mrs. Carter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to speak to the young lady up-stairs,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw up her hands with a quick gesture of surrender. &ldquo;I've done all I
      could,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;She won't like it very well, but&mdash;she's in
      the room over the parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went eagerly up the ladder-like stairs, to the rag-carpeted hall. Two
      doors were open, showing interiors of four poster beds and high bureaus.
      The door of the room over the parlor was almost closed. I hesitated in the
      hallway: after all, what right had I to intrude on her? But she settled my
      difficulty by throwing open the door and facing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Miss West,&rdquo; I stammered. &ldquo;It has just occurred
      to me that I am unpardonably rude. I saw the hat down-stairs and I&mdash;I
      guessed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hat!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I might have known. Does Richey know I am here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so.&rdquo; I turned to go down the stairs again. Then I halted.
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; I said, in an attempt at justification, &ldquo;I'm in rather a
      mess these days, and I'm apt to do irresponsible things. It is not
      impossible that I shall be arrested, in a day or so, for the murder of
      Simon Harrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her breath in sharply. &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Then they have
      found you after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't regard it as anything more than&mdash;er&mdash;inconvenient,&rdquo; I
      lied. &ldquo;They can't convict me, you know. Almost all the witnesses are
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not deceived for a moment. She came over to me and stood, both
      hands on the rail of the stair. &ldquo;I know just how grave it is,&rdquo; she said
      quietly. &ldquo;My grandfather will not leave one stone unturned, and he can be
      terrible&mdash;terrible. But&rdquo;&mdash;she looked directly into my eyes as I
      stood below her on the stairs&mdash;&ldquo;the time may come&mdash;soon&mdash;when
      I can help you. I'm afraid I shall not want to; I'm a dreadful coward, Mr.
      Blakeley. But&mdash;I will.&rdquo; She tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would let me help you,&rdquo; I said unsteadily. &ldquo;Let us make it a
      bargain: each help the other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head with a sad little smile. &ldquo;I am only as unhappy as
      I deserve to be,&rdquo; she said. And when I protested and took a step toward
      her she retreated, with her hands out before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you ask me all the questions you are thinking?&rdquo; she demanded,
      with a catch in her voice. &ldquo;Oh, I know them. Or are you afraid to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her, at the lines around her eyes, at the drawn look about her
      mouth. Then I held out my hand. &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; I said, as she gave me hers.
      &ldquo;There is nothing in God's green earth I am afraid of, save of trouble for
      you. To ask questions would be to imply a lack of faith. I ask you
      nothing. Some day, perhaps, you will come to me yourself and let me help
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment I was out in the golden sunshine: the birds were singing
      carols of joy: I walked dizzily through rainbow-colored clouds, past the
      twins, cherubs now, swinging on the gate. It was a new world into which I
      stepped from the Carter farm-house that morning, for&mdash;I had kissed
      her!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. AT THE TABLE NEXT
    </h2>
    <p>
      McKnight and Hotchkiss were sauntering slowly down the road as I caught up
      with them. As usual, the little man was busy with some abstruse mental
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is this,&rdquo; he was saying, his brows knitted in thought, &ldquo;if a
      left-handed man, standing in the position of the man in the picture,
      should jump from a car, would he be likely to sprain his right ankle? When
      a right-handed man prepares for a leap of that kind, my theory is that he
      would hold on with his right hand, and alight at the proper time, on his
      right foot. Of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine, although I don't know,&rdquo; interrupted McKnight, &ldquo;that a man
      either ambidextrous or one-armed, jumping from the Washington Flier, would
      be more likely to land on his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;what difference does it make whether Sullivan
      used one hand or the other? One pair of handcuffs will put both hands out
      of commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As usual when one of his pet theories was attacked, Hotchkiss looked
      aggrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he expostulated, &ldquo;don't you understand what bearing this
      has on the case? How was the murdered man lying when he was found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his back,&rdquo; I said promptly, &ldquo;head toward the engine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;and what then? Your heart lies under your fifth
      intercostal space, and to reach it a right-handed blow would have struck
      either down or directly in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, gentleman, the point of entrance for the stiletto was below the
      heart, striking up! As Harrington lay with his head toward the engine, a
      person in the aisle must have used the left hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight's eyes sought mine and he winked at me solemnly as I
      unostentatiously transferred the hat I was carrying to my right hand. Long
      training has largely counterbalanced heredity in my case, but I still
      pitch ball, play tennis and carve with my left hand. But Hotchkiss was too
      busy with his theories to notice me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were only just in time for our train back to Baltimore, but McKnight
      took advantage of a second's delay to shake the station agent warmly by
      the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to express my admiration for you,&rdquo; he said beamingly. &ldquo;Ability of
      your order is thrown away here. You should have been a city policeman, my
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The agent looked a trifle uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady was the one who told me to keep still,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight glanced at me, gave the agent's hand a final shake, and climbed
      on board. But I knew perfectly that he had guessed the reason for my
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very silent on the way home. Hotchkiss, too, had little to say. He
      was reading over his notes intently, stopping now and then to make a
      penciled addition. Just before we left the train Richey turned to me. &ldquo;I
      suppose it was the key to the door that she tied to the gate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably. I did not ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious, her locking that fellow in,&rdquo; he reflected.

</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;You may depend on
      it, there was a good reason for it all. And I wish you wouldn't be so
      suspicious of motives, Rich,&rdquo; I said warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only yesterday you were the suspicious one,&rdquo; he retorted, and we lapsed
      into strained silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when we got to Washington. One of Mrs. Klopton's small
      tyrannies was exacting punctuality at meals, and, like several other
      things, I respected it. There are always some concessions that should be
      made in return for faithful service.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as my dinner hour of seven was long past, McKnight and I went to a
      little restaurant down town where they have a very decent way of fixing
      chicken a la King. Hotchkiss had departed, economically bent, for a small
      hotel where he lived on the American plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to think some things over,&rdquo; he said in response to my invitation
      to dinner, &ldquo;and, anyhow, there's no use dining out when I pay the same,
      dinner or no dinner, where I am stopping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day had been hot, and the first floor dining-room was sultry in spite
      of the palms and fans which attempted to simulate the verdure and breezes
      of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was crowded, too, with a typical summer night crowd, and, after sitting
      for a few minutes in a sweltering corner, we got up and went to the
      smaller dining-room up-stairs. Here it was not so warm, and we settled
      ourselves comfortably by a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over in a corner half a dozen boys on their way back to school were
      ragging a perspiring waiter, a proceeding so exactly to McKnight's taste
      that he insisted on going over to join them. But their table was full, and
      somehow that kind of fun had lost its point for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from us a very stout, middle-aged man, apoplectic with the heat,
      was elephantinely jolly for the benefit of a bored-looking girl across the
      table from him, and at the next table a newspaper woman ate alone, the
      last edition propped against the water-bottle before her, her hat, for
      coolness, on the corner of the table. It was a motley Bohemian crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked over the room casually, while McKnight ordered the meal. Then my
      attention was attracted to the table next to ours. Two people were sitting
      there, so deep in conversation that they did not notice us. The woman's
      face was hidden under her hat, as she traced the pattern of the cloth
      mechanically with her fork. But the man's features stood out clear in the
      light of the candles on the table. It was Bronson!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shows the strain, doesn't he?&rdquo; McKnight said, holding up the wine list
      as if he read from it. &ldquo;Who's the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; I replied, in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the chicken came, I still found myself gazing now and then at the
      abstracted couple near me. Evidently the subject of conversation was
      unpleasant. Bronson was eating little, the woman not at all. Finally he
      got up, pushed his chair back noisily, thrust a bill at the waiter and
      stalked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman sat still for a moment; then, with an apparent resolution to
      make the best of it, she began slowly to eat the meal before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the quarrel had taken away her appetite, for the mixture in our
      chafing-dish was hardly ready to serve before she pushed her chair back a
      little and looked around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught my first glimpse of her face then, and I confess it startled me.
      It was the tall, stately woman of the Ontario, the woman I had last seen
      cowering beside the road, rolling pebbles in her hand, blood streaming
      from a cut over her eye. I could see the scar now, a little affair, about
      an inch long, gleaming red through its layers of powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, quite unexpectedly, she turned and looked directly at me. After
      a minute's uncertainty, she bowed, letting her eyes rest on mine with a
      calmly insolent stare. She glanced at McKnight for a moment, then back to
      me. When she looked away again I breathed easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked McKnight under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ontario.&rdquo; I formed it with my lips rather than said it. McKnight's
      eyebrows went up and he looked with increased interest at the black-gowned
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ate little after that. The situation was rather bad for me, I began to
      see. Here was a woman who could, if she wished, and had any motive for so
      doing, put me in jail under a capital charge. A word from her to the
      police, and polite surveillance would become active interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, she could say that she had seen me, just after the wreck, with
      a young woman from the murdered man's car, and thus probably bring Alison
      West into the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising, then, that I ate little. The woman across seemed in
      no hurry to go. She loitered over a demi-tasse, and that finished, sat
      with her elbow on the table, her chin in her hand, looking darkly at the
      changing groups in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fun at the table where the college boys sat began to grow a little
      noisy; the fat man, now a purplish shade, ambled away behind his slim
      companion; the newspaper woman pinned on her business-like hat and stalked
      out. Still the woman at the next table waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief when the meal was over. We got our hats and were about to
      leave the room, when a waiter touched me on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the lady at the table near the
      window, the lady in black, sir, would like to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked down between the rows of tables to where the woman sat alone, her
      chin still resting on her hand, her black eyes still insolently staring,
      this time at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to go,&rdquo; I said to McKnight hurriedly. &ldquo;She knows all about that
      affair and she'd be a bad enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like her lamps,&rdquo; McKnight observed, after a glance at her.
      &ldquo;Better jolly her a little. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE NOTES AND A BARGAIN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I went back slowly to where the woman sat alone.
    </h3>
    <p>
      She smiled rather oddly as I drew near, and pointed to the chair Bronson
      had vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Blakeley,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to take a few minutes of
      your valuable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; I sat down opposite her and glanced at a cuckoo clock on the
      wall. &ldquo;I am sorry, but I have only a few minutes. If you&mdash;&rdquo; She
      laughed a little, not very pleasantly, and opening a small black fan
      covered with spangles, waved it slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think we are about to make a bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bargain?&rdquo; I asked incredulously. &ldquo;You have a second advantage of me.
      You know my name&rdquo;&mdash;I paused suggestively and she took the cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mrs. Conway,&rdquo; she said, and flicked a crumb off the table with an
      over-manicured finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was scarcely a surprise. I had already surmised that this might
      be the woman whom rumor credited as being Bronson's common-law wife.
      Rumor, I remembered, had said other things even less pleasant, things
      which had been brought out at Bronson's arrest for forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We met last under less fortunate circumstances,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;I have
      been fit for nothing since that terrible day. And you&mdash;you had a
      broken arm, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still have it,&rdquo; I said, with a lame attempt at jocularity; &ldquo;but to have
      escaped at all was a miracle. We have much, indeed, to be thankful for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we have,&rdquo; she said carelessly, &ldquo;although sometimes I doubt it.&rdquo;
       She was looking somberly toward the door through which her late companion
      had made his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent for me&mdash;&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I sent for you.&rdquo; She roused herself and sat erect. &ldquo;Now, Mr.
      Blakeley, have you found those papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers? What papers?&rdquo; I parried. I needed time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blakeley,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I think we can lay aside all
      subterfuge. In the first place let me refresh your mind about a few
      things. The Pittsburg police are looking for the survivors of the car
      Ontario; there are three that I know of&mdash;yourself, the young woman
      with whom you left the scene of the wreck, and myself. The wreck, you will
      admit, was a fortunate one for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the time of the collision you were in rather a hole,&rdquo; she went on,
      looking at me with a disagreeable smile. &ldquo;You were, if I remember, accused
      of a rather atrocious crime. There was a lot of corroborative evidence,
      was there not? I seem to remember a dirk and the murdered man's
      pocket-book in your possession, and a few other things that were&mdash;well,
      rather unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was thrown a bit off my guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember also,&rdquo; I said quickly, &ldquo;that a man disappeared from the car,
      taking my clothes, papers and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember that you said so.&rdquo; Her tone was quietly insulting, and I bit
      my lip at having been caught. It was no time to make a defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have missed one calculation,&rdquo; I said coldly, &ldquo;and that is, the
      discovery of the man who left the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found him?&rdquo; She bent forward, and again I regretted my hasty
      speech. &ldquo;I knew it; I said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to find him,&rdquo; I asserted, with a confidence I did not feel.
      &ldquo;We can produce at any time proof that a man left the Flier a few miles
      beyond the wreck. And we can find him, I am positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not found him yet?&rdquo; She was clearly disappointed. &ldquo;Well, so
      be it. Now for our bargain. You will admit that I am no fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no such admission, and she smiled mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How flattering you are!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Very well. Now for the premises. You
      take to Pittsburg four notes held by the Mechanics' National Bank, to have
      Mr. Gilmore, who is ill, declare his indorsement of them forged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the journey back to Pittsburg two things happen to you: you lose your
      clothing, your valise and your papers, including the notes, and you are
      accused of murder. In fact, Mr. Blakeley, the circumstances were most
      singular, and the evidence&mdash;well, almost conclusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was completely at her mercy, but I gnawed my lip with irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the bargain.&rdquo; She leaned over and lowered her voice. &ldquo;A fair
      exchange, you know. The minute you put those four notes in my hand&mdash;that
      minute the blow to my head has caused complete forgetfulness as to the
      events of that awful morning. I am the only witness, and I will be silent.
      Do you understand? They will call off their dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My head was buzzing with the strangeness of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, striving to gain time, &ldquo;I haven't the notes. I can't give
      you what I haven't got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had the case continued,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;You expect to find
      them. Another thing,&rdquo; she added slowly, watching my face, &ldquo;if you don't
      get them soon, Bronson will have them. They have been offered to him
      already, but at a prohibitive price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, bewildered, &ldquo;what is your object in coming to me? If
      Bronson will get them anyhow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shut her fan with a click and her face was not particularly pleasant
      to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dense,&rdquo; she said insolently. &ldquo;I want those papers&mdash;for
      myself, not for Andy Bronson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the idea is,&rdquo; I said, ignoring her tone, &ldquo;that you think you have me
      in a hole, and that if I find those papers and give them to you you will
      let me out. As I understand it, our friend Bronson, under those
      circumstances, will also be in a hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notes would be of no use to you for a limited length of time,&rdquo; I went
      on, watching her narrowly. &ldquo;If they are not turned over to the state's
      attorney within a reasonable time there will have to be a nolle pros&mdash;that
      is, the case will simply be dropped for lack of evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week would answer, I think,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;You will do it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, although I was not especially cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll not do it. I expect to come across the notes any time now, and I
      expect just as certainly to turn them over to the state's attorney when I
      get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got up suddenly, pushing her chair back with a noisy grating sound
      that turned many eyes toward us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're more of a fool than I thought you,&rdquo; she sneered, and left me at
      the table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. McKNIGHT'S THEORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      I confess I was staggered. The people at the surrounding tables, after
      glancing curiously in my direction, looked away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got my hat and went out in a very uncomfortable frame of mind. That she
      would inform the police at once of what she knew I never doubted, unless
      possibly she would give a day or two's grace in the hope that I would
      change my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reviewed the situation as I waited for a car. Two passed me going in the
      opposite direction, and on the first one I saw Bronson, his hat over his
      eyes, his arms folded, looking moodily ahead. Was it imagination? or was
      the small man huddled in the corner of the rear seat Hotchkiss?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the car rolled on I found myself smiling. The alert little man was for
      all the world like a terrier, ever on the scent, and scouring about in
      every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found McKnight at the Incubator, with his coat off, working with
      enthusiasm and a manicure file over the horn of his auto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the worst horn I ever ran across,&rdquo; he groaned, without looking up,
      as I came in. &ldquo;The blankety-blank thing won't blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He punched it savagely, finally eliciting a faint throaty croak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like croup,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;My sister-in-law uses camphor and goose
      greese for it; or how about a spice poultice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But McKnight never sees any jokes but his own. He flung the horn
      clattering into a corner, and collapsed sulkily into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you're through manicuring that horn, I'll tell you
      about my talk with the lady in black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo; asked McKnight languidly. &ldquo;Police watching her, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. The fact is, Rich, there's the mischief to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stogie came in, bringing a few additions to our comfort. When he went out
      I told my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I had seen this woman before the
      morning of the wreck. She was buying her Pullman ticket when I did. Then
      the next morning, when the murder was discovered, she grew hysterical, and
      I gave her some whisky. The third and last time I saw her, until to-night,
      was when she crouched beside the road, after the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight slid down in his chair until his weight rested on the small of
      his back, and put his feet on the big reading table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather a facer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's really too good a situation for a
      commonplace lawyer. It ought to be dramatized. You can't agree, of course;
      and by refusing you run the chance of jail, at least, and of having Alison
      brought into publicity, which is out of the question. You say she was at
      the Pullman window when you were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I bought her ticket for her. Gave her lower eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you took ten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight straightened up and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she thought you were in lower ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she did, if she thought at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen, man.&rdquo; McKnight was growing excited. &ldquo;What do you figure out
      of this? The Conway woman knows you have taken the notes to Pittsburg. The
      probabilities are that she follows you there, on the chance of an
      opportunity to get them, either for Bronson or herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing during the trip over or during the day in Pittsburg; but
      she learns the number of your berth as you buy it at the Pullman ticket
      office in Pittsburg, and she thinks she sees her chance. No one could have
      foreseen that that drunken fellow would have crawled into your berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I figure it out this way: She wanted those notes desperately&mdash;does
      still&mdash;not for Bronson, but to hold over his head for some purpose.
      In the night, when everything is quiet, she slips behind the curtains of
      lower ten, where the man's breathing shows he is asleep. Didn't you say he
      snored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did!&rdquo; I affirmed. &ldquo;But I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now keep still and listen. She gropes cautiously around in the darkness,
      finally discovering the wallet under the pillow. Can't you see it
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning forward, excitedly, and I could almost see the gruesome
      tragedy he was depicting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She draws out the wallet. Then, perhaps she remembers the alligator bag,
      and on the possibility that the notes are there, instead of in the
      pocket-book, she gropes around for it. Suddenly, the man awakes and
      clutches at the nearest object, perhaps her neck chain, which breaks. She
      drops the pocket-book and tries to escape, but he has caught her right
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all in silence; the man is still stupidly drunk. But he holds her
      in a tight grip. Then the tragedy. She must get away; in a minute the car
      will be aroused. Such a woman, on such an errand, does not go without some
      sort of a weapon, in this case a dagger, which, unlike a revolver, is
      noiseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a quick thrust&mdash;she's a big woman and a bold one&mdash;she
      strikes. Possibly Hotchkiss is right about the left-hand blow. Harrington
      may have held her right hand, or perhaps she held the dirk in her left
      hand as she groped with her right. Then, as the man falls back, and his
      grasp relaxes, she straightens and attempts to get away. The swaying of
      the car throws her almost into your berth, and, trembling with terror, she
      crouches behind the curtains of lower ten until everything is still. Then
      she goes noiselessly back to her berth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to fit partly, at least,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In the morning when she found
      that the crime had been not only fruitless, but that she had searched the
      wrong berth and killed the wrong man; when she saw me emerge, unhurt, just
      as she was bracing herself for the discovery of my dead body, then she
      went into hysterics. You remember, I gave her some whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really seems a tenable theory. But, like the Sullivan theory, there
      are one or two things that don't agree with the rest. For one thing, how
      did the remainder of that chain get into Alison West's possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may have picked it up on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll admit that,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and I'm sure I hope so. Then how did the
      murdered man's pocket-book get into the sealskin bag? And the dirk, how
      account for that, and the blood-stains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what's the use,&rdquo; asked McKnight aggrievedly, &ldquo;of my building up
      beautiful theories for you to pull down? We'll take it to Hotchkiss. Maybe
      he can tell from the blood-stains if the murderer's finger nails were
      square or pointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotchkiss is no fool,&rdquo; I said warmly. &ldquo;Under all his theories there's a
      good hard layer of common sense. And we must remember, Rich, that neither
      of our theories includes the woman at Doctor Van Kirk's hospital, that the
      charming picture you have just drawn does not account for Alison West's
      connection with the case, or for the bits of telegram in the Sullivan
      fellow's pajamas pocket. You are like the man who put the clock together;
      you've got half of the works left over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go home,&rdquo; said McKnight disgustedly. &ldquo;I'm no Edgar Allan Poe. What's
      the use of coming here and asking me things if you're so particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one of his quick changes of mood, he picked up his guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a Hawaiian song about a fat lady, oh,
      ignorant one! and how she fell off her mule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for all the lightness of the words, the voice that followed me down
      the stairs was anything but cheery.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;There was a Kanaka in Balu did dwell,
     Who had for his daughter a monstrous fat girl&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      he sang in his clear tenor. I paused on the lower floor and listened. He
      had stopped singing as abruptly as he had begun.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. AT THE BOARDING-HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had not been home for thirty-six hours, since the morning of the
      preceding day. Johnson was not in sight, and I let myself in quietly with
      my latchkey. It was almost midnight, and I had hardly settled myself in
      the library when the bell rang and I was surprised to find Hotchkiss, much
      out of breath, in the vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, come in, Mr. Hotchkiss,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I thought you were going home to
      go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was, so I was.&rdquo; He dropped into a chair beside my reading lamp and
      mopped his face. &ldquo;And here it is almost midnight, and I'm wider awake than
      ever. I've seen Sullivan, Mr. Blakeley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were following Bronson at eight o'clock. Was that when it happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort. When I left you at the door of the restaurant, I
      turned and almost ran into a plain clothes man from the central office. I
      know him pretty well; once or twice he has taken me with him on
      interesting bits of work. He knows my hobby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him, too, probably. It was the man Arnold, the detective whom
      the state's attorney has had watching Bronson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson being otherwise occupied, I had asked for Arnold myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he stopped me at once; said he'd been on the fellow's tracks since
      early morning and had had no time for luncheon. Bronson, it seems, isn't
      eating much these days. I at once jotted down the fact, because it argued
      that he was being bothered by the man with the notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might point to other things,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Indigestion, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss ignored me. &ldquo;Well, Arnold had some reason for thinking that
      Bronson would try to give him the slip that night, so he asked me to stay
      around the private entrance there while he ran across the Street and got
      something to eat. It seemed a fair presumption that, as he had gone there
      with a lady, they would dine leisurely, and Arnold would have plenty of
      time to get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about your own dinner?&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said pompously, &ldquo;I have given you a wrong estimate of Wilson
      Budd Hotchkiss if you think that a question of dinner would even obtrude
      itself on his mind at such a time as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a frail little man, and to-night he looked pale with heat and
      over-exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have any luncheon?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was somewhat embarrassed at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;really, Mr. Blakeley, the events of the day were so engrossing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I'm not going to see you drop on the floor from
      exhaustion. Just wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the pantry, only to be confronted with rows of locked doors
      and empty dishes. Downstairs, in the basement kitchen, however, I found
      two unattractive looking cold chops, some dry bread and a piece of cake,
      wrapped in a napkin, and from its surreptitious and generally hang-dog
      appearance, destined for the coachman in the stable at the rear. Trays
      there were none&mdash;everything but the chairs and tables seemed under
      lock and key, and there was neither napkin, knife nor fork to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The luncheon was not attractive in appearance, but Hotchkiss ate his cold
      chops and gnawed at the crusts as though he had been famished, while he
      told his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had been there only a few minutes,&rdquo; he said, with a chop in one hand
      and the cake in the other, &ldquo;when Bronson rushed out and cut across the
      street. He's a tall man, Mr. Blakeley, and I had had work keeping close.
      It was a relief when he jumped on a passing car, although being well
      behind, it was a hard run for me to catch him. He had left the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once on the car, we simply rode from one end of the line to the other and
      back again. I suppose he was passing the time, for he looked at his watch
      now and then, and when I did once get a look at us face it made me&mdash;er&mdash;uncomfortable.
      He could have crushed me like a fly, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had brought Mr. Hotchkiss a glass of wine, and he was looking better. He
      stopped to finish it, declining with a wave of his hand to have it
      refilled, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About nine o'clock or a little later he got off somewhere near Washington
      Circle. He went along one of the residence streets there, turned to his
      left a square or two, and rang a bell. He had been admitted when I got
      there, but I guessed from the appearance of the place that it was a
      boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited a few minutes and rang the bell. When a maid answered it, I
      asked for Mr. Sullivan. Of course there was no Mr. Sullivan there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I was sorry; that the man I was looking for was a new boarder. She
      was sure there was no such boarder in the house; the only new arrival was
      a man on the third floor&mdash;she thought his name was Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My friend has a cousin by that name,' I said. 'I'll just go up and see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wanted to show me up, but I said it was unnecessary. So after telling
      me it was the bedroom and sitting-room on the third floor front, I went
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met a couple of men on the stairs, but neither of them paid any
      attention to me. A boarding-house is the easiest place in the world to
      enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're not always so easy to leave,&rdquo; I put in, to his evident
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got to the third story, I took out a bunch of keys and posted
      myself by a door near the ones the girl had indicated. I could hear voices
      in one of the front rooms, but could not understand what they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no violent dispute, but a steady hum. Then Bronson jerked the
      door open. If he had stepped into the hall he would have seen me fitting a
      key into the door before me. But he spoke before he came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You're acting like a maniac,' he said. 'You know I can get those things
      some way; I'm not going to threaten you. It isn't necessary. You know me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It would be no use,' the other man said. 'I tell you, I haven't seen the
      notes for ten days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But you will,' Bronson said savagely. 'You're standing in your own way,
      that's all. If you're holding out expecting me to raise my figure, you're
      making a mistake. It's my last offer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I couldn't take it if it was for a million,' said the man inside the
      room. 'I'd do it, I expect, if I could. The best of us have our price.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bronson slammed the door then, and flung past me down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a couple of minutes I knocked at the door, and a tall man about
      your size, Mr. Blakeley, opened it. He was very blond, with a smooth face
      and blue eyes&mdash;what I think you would call a handsome man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I beg your pardon for disturbing you,' I said. 'Can you tell me which is
      Mr. Johnson's room? Mr. Francis Johnson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I can not say,' he replied civilly. 'I've only been here a few days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thanked him and left, but I had had a good look at him, and I think I'd
      know him readily any place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat for a few minutes thinking it over. &ldquo;But what did he mean by saying
      he hadn't seen the notes for ten days? And why is Bronson making the
      overtures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was lying,&rdquo; Hotchkiss reflected. &ldquo;Bronson hasn't reached his
      figure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a big advance, Mr. Hotchkiss, and I appreciate what you have done
      more than I can tell you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And now, if you can locate any of my
      property in this fellow's room, we'll send him up for larceny, and at
      least have him where we can get at him. I'm going to Cresson to-morrow, to
      try to trace him a little from there. But I'll be back in a couple of
      days, and we'll begin to gather in these scattered threads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss rubbed his hands together delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's what we want to do, Mr. Blakeley. We'll
      gather up the threads ourselves; if we let the police in too soon, they'll
      tangle it up again. I'm not vindictive by nature; but when a fellow like
      Sullivan not only commits a murder, but goes to all sorts of trouble to
      put the burden of guilt on an innocent man&mdash;I say hunt him down,
      sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are convinced, of course, that Sullivan did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; He looked over his glasses at me with the air of a man whose
      mental attitude is unassailable. &ldquo;Well, listen to this,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told him at length of my encounter with Bronson in the restaurant,
      of the bargain proposed by Mrs. Conway, and finally of McKnight's new
      theory. But, although he was impressed, he was far from convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a very vivid piece of imagination,&rdquo; he said drily; &ldquo;but while it
      fits the evidence as far as it goes, it doesn't go far enough. How about
      the stains in lower seven, the dirk, and the wallet? Haven't we even got
      motive in that telegram from Bronson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;but that bit of chain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Perhaps, like yourself, Sullivan wore glasses
      with a chain. Our not finding them does not prove they did not exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there I made an error; half confidences are always mistakes. I could
      not tell of the broken chain in Alison West's gold purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one o'clock when Hotchkiss finally left. We had by that time
      arranged a definite course of action&mdash;Hotchkiss to search Sullivan's
      rooms and if possible find evidence to have him held for larceny, while I
      went to Cresson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, however, when I entered the train the following morning,
      Hotchkiss was already there. He had bought a new note-book, and was
      sharpening a fresh pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I changed my plans, you see,&rdquo; he said, bustling his newspaper aside for
      me. &ldquo;It is no discredit to your intelligence, Mr. Blakeley, but you lack
      the professional eye, the analytical mind. You legal gentlemen call a
      spade a spade, although it may be a shovel.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'A primrose by the river's brim
     A yellow primrose was to him,
     And nothing more!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I quoted as the train pulled out.

      CHAPTER XXIII. A NIGHT AT THE LAURELS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I slept most of the way to Cresson, to the disgust of the little
      detective. Finally he struck up an acquaintance with a kindly-faced old
      priest on his way home to his convent school, armed with a roll of dance
      music and surreptitious bundles that looked like boxes of candy. From
      scraps of conversation I gleaned that there had been mysterious
      occurrences at the convent,&mdash;ending in the theft of what the reverend
      father called vaguely, &ldquo;a quantity of undermuslins.&rdquo; I dropped asleep at
      that point, and when I roused a few moments later, the conversation had
      progressed. Hotchkiss had a diagram on an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this window bolted, and that one inaccessible, and if, as you say,
      the&mdash;er&mdash;garments were in a tub here at X, then, as you hold the
      key to the other door,&mdash;I think you said the convent dog did not
      raise any disturbance? Pardon a personal question, but do you ever walk in
      your sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest looked bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what to do,&rdquo; Hotchkiss said cheerfully, leaning forward,
      &ldquo;look around a little yourself before you call in the police. Somnambulism
      is a queer thing. It's a question whether we are most ourselves sleeping
      or waking. Ever think of that? Live a saintly life all day, prayers and
      matins and all that, and the subconscious mind hikes you out of bed at
      night to steal undermuslins! Subliminal theft, so to speak. Better examine
      the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dozed again. When I wakened Hotchkiss sat alone, and the priest, from a
      corner, was staring at him dazedly, over his breviary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was raining when we reached Cresson, a wind-driven rain that had forced
      the agent at the newsstand to close himself in, and that beat back from
      the rails in parallel lines of white spray. As he went up the main street,
      Hotchkiss was cheerfully oblivious of the weather, of the threatening
      dusk, of our generally draggled condition. My draggled condition, I should
      say, for he improved every moment,&mdash;his eyes brighter, his ruddy face
      ruddier, his collar newer and glossier. Sometime, when it does not
      encircle the little man's neck, I shall test that collar with a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was growing steadily more depressed: I loathed my errand and its
      necessity. I had always held that a man who played the spy on a woman was
      beneath contempt. Then, I admit I was afraid of what I might learn. For a
      time, however, this promised to be a negligible quantity. The streets of
      the straggling little mountain town had been clean-washed of humanity by
      the downpour. Windows and doors were inhospitably shut, and from around an
      occasional drawn shade came narrow strips of light that merely emphasized
      our gloom. When Hotchkiss' umbrella turned inside out, I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know where you are going,&rdquo; I snarled, &ldquo;I don't care. But I'm
      going to get under cover inside of ten seconds. I'm not amphibious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ducked into the next shelter, which happened to be the yawning entrance
      to a livery stable, and shook myself, dog fashion. Hotchkiss wiped his
      collar with his handkerchief. It emerged gleaming and unwilted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do as well as any place,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice above the
      rattle of the rain. &ldquo;Got to make a beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on the usual chair without a back, just inside the door, and
      stared out at the darkening street. The whole affair had an air of
      unreality. Now that I was there, I doubted the necessity, or the value, of
      the journey. I was wet and uncomfortable. Around me, with Cresson as a
      center, stretched an irregular circumference of mountain, with possibly a
      ten-mile radius, and in it I was to find the residence of a woman whose
      first name I did not know, and a man who, so far, had been a purely
      chimerical person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss had penetrated the steaming interior of the cave, and now his
      voice, punctuated by the occasional thud of horses' hoofs, came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something light will do,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;A runabout, perhaps.&rdquo; He came
      forward rubbing his hands, followed by a thin man in overalls. &ldquo;Mr. Peck
      says,&rdquo; he began,&mdash;&ldquo;this is Mr. Peck of Peck and Peck,&mdash;says that
      the place we are looking for is about seven miles from the town. It's
      clearing, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; I returned savagely. &ldquo;And we don't want a runabout, Mr. Peck.
      What we require is hermetically sealed diving suit. I suppose there isn't
      a machine to be had?&rdquo; Mr. Peck gazed at me, in silence: machine to him
      meant other things than motors. &ldquo;Automobile,&rdquo; I supplemented. His face
      cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None but private affairs. I can give you a good buggy with a rubber
      apron. Mike, is the doctor's horse in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am still uncertain as to whether the raw-boned roan we took out that
      night over the mountains was the doctor's horse or not. If it was, the
      doctor may be a good doctor, but he doesn't know anything about a horse.
      And furthermore, I hope he didn't need the beast that miserable evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they harnessed the horse, Hotchkiss told me what he had learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six Curtises in the town and vicinity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sort of family name
      around here. One of them is telegraph operator at the station. Person we
      are looking for is&mdash;was&mdash;a wealthy widow with a brother named
      Sullivan! Both supposed to have been killed on the Flier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her brother,&rdquo; I repeated stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Hotchkiss went on, &ldquo;three people, in one party, took the train
      here that night, Miss West, Mrs. Curtis and Sullivan. The two women had
      the drawing-room, Sullivan had lower seven. What we want to find out is
      just who these people were, where they came from, if Bronson knew them,
      and how Miss West became entangled with them. She may have married
      Sullivan, for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fell into gloom after that. The roan was led unwillingly into the
      weather, Hotchkiss and I in eclipse behind the blanket. The liveryman
      stood in the doorway and called directions to us. &ldquo;You can't miss it,&rdquo; he
      finished. &ldquo;Got the name over the gate anyhow, 'The Laurels.' The servants
      are still there: leastways, we didn't bring them down.&rdquo; He even took a
      step into the rain as Hotchkiss picked up the lines. &ldquo;If you're going to
      settle the estate,&rdquo; he bawled, &ldquo;don't forget us, Peck and Peck. A
      half-bushel of name and a bushel of service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss could not drive. Born a clerk, he guided the roan much as he
      would drive a bad pen. And the roan spattered through puddles and splashed
      ink&mdash;mud, that is&mdash;until I was in a frenzy of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to say when we get there?&rdquo; I asked after I had finally
      taken the reins in my one useful hand. &ldquo;Get out there at midnight and tell
      the servants we have come to ask a few questions about the family? It's an
      idiotic trip anyhow; I wish I had stayed at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roan fell just then, and we had to crawl out and help him up. By the
      time we had partly unharnessed him our matches were gone, and the small
      bicycle lamp on the buggy was wavering only too certainly. We were covered
      with mud, panting with exertion, and even Hotchkiss showed a disposition
      to be surly. The rain, which had lessened for a time, came on again, the
      lightning flashes doing more than anything else to reveal our isolated
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mile saw us, if possible, more despondent. The water in our
      clothes had had time to penetrate: the roan had sprained his shoulder, and
      drew us along in a series of convulsive jerks. And then through the
      rain-spattered window of the blanket, I saw a light. It was a small light,
      rather yellow, and it lasted perhaps thirty seconds. Hotchkiss missed it,
      and was inclined to doubt me. But in a couple of minutes the roan hobbled
      to the side of the road and stopped, and I made out a break in the pines
      and an arched gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small gate, too narrow for the buggy. I pulled the horse into as
      much shelter as possible under the trees, and we got out. Hotchkiss tied
      the beast and we left him there, head down against the driving rain,
      drooping and dejected. Then we went toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long walk. The path bent and twisted, and now and then we lost
      it. We were climbing as we went. Oddly there were no lights ahead,
      although it was only ten o'clock,&mdash;not later. Hotchkiss kept a little
      ahead of me, knocking into trees now and then, but finding the path in
      half the time I should have taken. Once, as I felt my way around a tree in
      the blackness, I put my hand unexpectedly on his shoulder, and felt a
      shudder go down my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect me to do?&rdquo; he protested, when I remonstrated. &ldquo;Hang
      out a red lantern? What was that? Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both stood peering into the gloom. The sharp patter of the rain on
      leaves had ceased, and from just ahead there came back to us the stealthy
      padding of feet in wet soil. My hand closed on Hotchkiss' shoulder, and we
      listened together, warily. The steps were close by, unmistakable. The next
      flash of lightning showed nothing moving: the house was in full view now,
      dark and uninviting, looming huge above a terrace, with an Italian garden
      at the side. Then the blackness again. Somebody's teeth were chattering: I
      accused Hotchkiss but he denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although I'm not very comfortable, I'll admit,&rdquo; he confessed; &ldquo;there was
      something breathing right at my elbow here a moment ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I took his elbow and steered him in what I made out to be the
      direction of the steps of the Italian garden. &ldquo;I saw a deer just ahead by
      the last flash; that's what you heard. By Jove, I hear wheels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We paused to listen and Hotchkiss put his hand on something close to us.
      &ldquo;Here's your deer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bronze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we neared the house the sense of surveillance we had had in the park
      gradually left us. Stumbling over flower beds, running afoul of a
      sun-dial, groping our way savagely along hedges and thorny banks, we
      reached the steps finally and climbed the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Hotchkiss fell over one of the two stone urns which, with
      tall boxwood trees in them, mounted guard at each side of the door. He
      didn't make any attempt to get up. He sat in a puddle on the brick floor
      of the terrace and clutched his leg and swore softly in Government
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasional relief of the lightning was gone. I could not see an
      outline of the house before me. We had no matches, and an instant's
      investigation showed that the windows were boarded and the house closed.
      Hotchkiss, still recumbent, was ascertaining the damage, tenderly peeling
      down his stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I don't know whether this moisture is
      blood or rain. I think I've broken a bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood is thicker than water,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Is it sticky? See if you can
      move your toes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause: Hotchkiss moved his toes. By that time I had found a
      knocker and was making the night hideous. But there was no response save
      the wind that blew sodden leaves derisively in our faces. Once Hotchkiss
      declared he heard a window-sash lifted, but renewed violence with the
      knocker produced no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only one thing to do,&rdquo; I said finally. &ldquo;I'll go back and try to
      bring the buggy up for you. You can't walk, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss sat back in his puddle and said he didn't think he could stir,
      but for me to go back to town and leave him, that he didn't have any
      family dependent on him, and that if he was going to have pneumonia he had
      probably got it already. I left him there, and started back to get the
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      If possible, it was worse than before. There was no lightning, and only by
      a miracle did I find the little gate again. I drew a long breath of
      relief, followed by another, equally long, of dismay. For I had found the
      hitching strap and there was nothing at the end of it! In a lull of the
      wind I seemed to hear, far off, the eager thud of stable-bound feet. So
      for the second time I climbed the slope to the Laurels, and on the way I
      thought of many things to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck the house at a new angle, for I found a veranda, destitute of
      chairs and furnishings, but dry and evidently roofed. It was better than
      the terrace, and so, by groping along the wall, I tried to make my way to
      Hotchkiss. That was how I found the open window. I had passed perhaps six,
      all closed, and to have my hand grope for the next one, and to find
      instead the soft drapery of an inner curtain, was startling, to say the
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Hotchkiss at last around an angle of the stone wall, and told him
      that the horse was gone. He was disconcerted, but not abased; maintaining
      that it was a new kind of knot that couldn't slip and that the horse must
      have chewed the halter through! He was less enthusiastic than I had
      expected about the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks uncommonly like a trap,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tell you there was some one
      in the park below when we were coming up. Man has a sixth sense that
      scientists ignore&mdash;a sense of the nearness of things. And all the
      time you have been gone, some one has been watching me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't see you,&rdquo; I maintained; &ldquo;I can't see you now. And your sense of
      contiguity didn't tell you about that flower crock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the end, of course, he consented to go with me. He was very lame, and I
      helped him around to the open window. He was full of moral courage, the
      little man: it was only the physical in him that quailed. And as we groped
      along, he insisted on going through the window first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a trap,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I have two arms to your one, and,
      besides, as I said before, life holds much for you. As for me, the
      government would merely lose an indifferent employee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he found I was going first he was rather hurt, but I did not wait for
      his protests. I swung my feet over the sill and dropped. I made a clutch
      at the window-frame with my good hand when I found no floor under my feet,
      but I was too late. I dropped probably ten feet and landed with a crash
      that seemed to split my ear-drums. I was thoroughly shaken, but in some
      miraculous way the bandaged arm had escaped injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake,&rdquo; Hotchkiss was calling from above, &ldquo;have you broken
      your back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I returned, as steadily as I could, &ldquo;merely driven it up through my
      skull. This is a staircase. I'm coming up to open another window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was eerie work, but I accomplished it finally, discovering, not without
      mishap, a room filled with more tables than I had ever dreamed of, tables
      that seemed to waylay and strike at me. When I had got a window open,
      Hotchkiss crawled through, and we were at last under shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first thought was for a light. The same laborious investigation that
      had landed us where we were, revealed that the house was lighted by
      electricity, and that the plant was not in operation. By accident I
      stumbled across a tabouret with smoking materials, and found a half dozen
      matches. The first one showed us the magnitude of the room we stood in,
      and revealed also a brass candle-stick by the open fireplace, a
      candle-stick almost four feet high, supporting a candle of similar
      colossal proportions. It was Hotchkiss who discovered that it had been
      recently lighted. He held the match to it and peered at it over his
      glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within ten minutes,&rdquo; he announced impressively, &ldquo;this candle has been
      burning. Look at the wax! And the wick! Both soft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it's the damp weather,&rdquo; I ventured, moving a little nearer to the
      circle of light. A gust of wind came in just then, and the flame turned
      over on its side and threatened demise. There was something almost
      ridiculous in the haste with which we put down the window and nursed the
      flicker to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiarly ghost-like appearance of the room added to the uncanniness
      of the situation. The furniture was swathed in white covers for the
      winter; even the pictures wore shrouds. And in a niche between two windows
      a bust on a pedestal, similarly wrapped, one arm extended under its
      winding sheet, made a most life-like ghost, if any ghost can be life-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the light of the candle we surveyed each other, and we were objects for
      mirth. Hotchkiss was taking off his sodden shoes and preparing to make
      himself comfortable, while I hung my muddy raincoat over the ghost in the
      corner. Thus habited, he presented a rakish but distinctly more
      comfortable appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When these people built,&rdquo; Hotchkiss said, surveying the huge dimensions
      of the room, &ldquo;they must have bought a mountain and built all over it. What
      a room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to be a living-room, although Hotchkiss remarked that it was
      much more like a dead one. It was probably fifty feet long and twenty-five
      feet wide. It was very high, too, with a domed ceiling, and a gallery ran
      around the entire room, about fifteen feet above the floor. The candle
      light did not penetrate beyond the dim outlines of the gallery rail, but I
      fancied the wall there hung with smaller pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss had discovered a fire laid in the enormous fireplace, and in a
      few minutes we were steaming before a cheerful blaze. Within the radius of
      its light and heat, we were comfortable again. But the brightness merely
      emphasized the gloom of the ghostly corners. We talked in subdued tones,
      and I smoked, a box of Russian cigarettes which I found in a table drawer.
      We had decided to stay all night, there being nothing else to do. I
      suggested a game of double-dummy bridge, but did not urge it when my
      companion asked me if it resembled euchre. Gradually, as the
      ecclesiastical candle paled in the firelight, we grew drowsy. I drew a
      divan into the cheerful area, and stretched myself out for sleep.
      Hotchkiss, who said the pain in his leg made him wakeful, sat wide-eyed by
      the fire, smoking a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no idea how much time had passed when something threw itself
      violently on my chest. I roused with a start and leaped to my feet, and a
      large Angora cat fell with a thump to the floor. The fire was still
      bright, and there was an odor of scorched leather through the room, from
      Hotchkiss' shoes. The little detective was sound asleep, his dead pipe in
      his fingers. The cat sat back on its haunches and wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain at the door into the hallway bellied slowly out into the room
      and fell again. The cat looked toward it and opened its mouth for another
      howl. I thrust at it with my foot, but it refused to move. Hotchkiss
      stirred uneasily, and his pipe clattered to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat was standing at my feet, staring behind me. Apparently it was
      following with its eyes, an object unseen to me, that moved behind me. The
      tip of its tail waved threateningly, but when I wheeled I saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the candle and made a circuit of the room. Behind the curtain that
      had moved the door was securely closed. The windows were shut and locked,
      and everywhere the silence was absolute. The cat followed me majestically.
      I stooped and stroked its head, but it persisted in its uncanny watching
      of the corners of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went back to my divan, after putting a fresh log on the fire, I was
      reassured. I took the precaution, and smiled at myself for doing it, to
      put the fire tongs within reach of my hand. But the cat would not let me
      sleep. After a time I decided that it wanted water, and I started out in
      search of some, carrying the candle without the stand. I wandered through
      several rooms, all closed and dismantled, before I found a small lavatory
      opening off a billiard room. The cat lapped steadily, and I filled a glass
      to take back with me. The candle flickered in a sickly fashion that
      threatened to leave me there lost in the wanderings of the many hallways,
      and from somewhere there came an occasional violent puff of wind. The cat
      stuck by my feet, with the hair on its back raised menacingly. I don't
      like cats; there is something psychic about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss was still asleep when I got back to the big room. I moved his
      boots back from the fire, and trimmed the candle. Then, with sleep gone
      from me, I lay back on my divan and reflected on many things: on my idiocy
      in coming; on Alison West, and the fact that only a week before she had
      been a guest in this very house; on Richey and the constraint that had
      come between us. From that I drifted back to Alison, and to the barrier my
      comparative poverty would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emptiness, the stillness were oppressive. Once I heard footsteps
      coming, rhythmical steps that neither hurried nor dragged, and seemed to
      mount endless staircases without coming any closer. I realized finally
      that I had not quite turned off the tap, and that the lavatory, which I
      had circled to reach, must be quite close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat lay by the fire, its nose on its folded paws, content in the
      warmth and companionship. I watched it idly. Now and then the green wood
      hissed in the fire, but the cat never batted an eye. Through an
      unshuttered window the lightning flashed. Suddenly the cat looked up. It
      lifted its head and stared directly at the gallery above. Then it blinked,
      and stared again. I was amused. Not until it had got up on its feet, eyes
      still riveted on the balcony, tail waving at the tip, the hair on its back
      a bristling brush, did I glance casually over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      From among the shadows a face gazed down at me, a face that seemed a
      fitting tenant of the ghostly room below. I saw it as plainly as I might
      see my own face in a mirror. While I stared at it with horrified eyes, the
      apparition faded. The rail was there, the Bokhara rug still swung from it,
      but the gallery was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat threw back its head and wailed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. HIS WIFE'S FATHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      I jumped up and seized the fire tongs. The cat's wail had roused
      Hotchkiss, who was wide-awake at once. He took in my offensive attitude,
      the tongs, the direction of my gaze, and needed nothing more. As he picked
      up the candle and darted out into the hall, I followed him. He made
      directly for the staircase, and part way up he turned off to the right
      through a small door. We were on the gallery itself; below us the fire
      gleamed cheerfully, the cat was not in sight. There was no sign of my
      ghostly visitant, but as we stood there the Bokhara rug, without warning,
      slid over the railing and fell to the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man or woman?&rdquo; Hotchkiss inquired in his most professional tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither&mdash;that is, I don't know. I didn't notice anything but the
      eyes,&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;They were looking a hole in me. If you'd seen that cat
      you would realize my state of mind. That was a traditional graveyard
      yowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you saw anything at all,&rdquo; he lied cheerfully. &ldquo;You dozed
      off, and the rest is the natural result of a meal on a buffet car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he examined the Bokhara carefully when we went down, and
      when I finally went to sleep he was reading the only book in sight&mdash;Elwell
      on Bridge. The first rays of daylight were coming mistily into the room
      when he roused me. He had his finger on his lips, and he whispered
      sibilantly while I tried to draw on my distorted boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we have him,&rdquo; he said triumphantly. &ldquo;I've been looking around
      some, and I can tell you this much. Just before we came in through the
      window last night, another man came. Only&mdash;he did not drop, as you
      did. He swung over to the stair railing, and then down. The rail is
      scratched. He was long enough ahead of us to go into the dining-room and
      get a decanter out of the sideboard. He poured out the liquor into a
      glass, left the decanter there, and took the whisky into the library
      across the hall. Then&mdash;he broke into a desk, using a paper knife for
      a jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, Hotchkiss,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;why, it may have been Sullivan
      himself! Confound your theories&mdash;he's getting farther away every
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Sullivan,&rdquo; Hotchkiss returned imperturbably. &ldquo;And he has not gone.
      His boots are by the library fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He probably had a dozen pairs where he could get them,&rdquo; I scoffed. &ldquo;And
      while you and I sat and slept, the very man we want to get our hands on
      leered at us over that railing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Softly, softly, my friend,&rdquo; Hotchkiss said, as I stamped into my other
      shoe. &ldquo;I did not say he was gone. Don't jump at conclusions. It is fatal
      to reasoning. As a matter of fact, he didn't relish a night on the
      mountains any more than we did. After he had unintentionally frightened
      you almost into paralysis, what would my gentleman naturally do? Go out in
      the storm again? Not if I know the Alice-sit-by-the-fire type. He went
      up-stairs, well up near the roof, locked himself in and went to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is there now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had no weapons. I am aware that the traditional hero is always armed,
      and that Hotchkiss as the low comedian should have had a revolver that
      missed fire. As a fact, we had nothing of the sort. Hotchkiss carried the
      fire tongs, but my sense of humor was too strong for me; I declined the
      poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All we want is a little peaceable conversation with him,&rdquo; I demurred. &ldquo;We
      can't brain him first and converse with him afterward. And anyhow, while I
      can't put my finger on the place, I think your theory is weak. If he
      wouldn't run a hundred miles through fire and water to get away from us,
      then he is not the man we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss, however, was certain. He had found the room and listened
      outside the door to the sleeper's heavy breathing, and so we climbed past
      luxurious suites, revealed in the deepening daylight, past long vistas of
      hall and boudoir. And we were both badly winded when we got there. It was
      a tower room, reached by narrow stairs, and well above the roof level.
      Hotchkiss was glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is partly good luck, but not all,&rdquo; he panted in a whisper. &ldquo;If we had
      persisted in the search last night, he would have taken alarm and fled.
      Now&mdash;we have him. Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a mighty rap at the door with the fire tongs, and stood expectant.
      Certainly he was right; some one moved within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Hello there!&rdquo; Hotchkiss bawled. &ldquo;You might as well come out. We
      won't hurt you, if you'll come peaceably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him we represent the law,&rdquo; I prompted. &ldquo;That's the customary thing,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment a bullet came squarely through the door and flattened
      itself with a sharp pst against the wall of the tower staircase. We ducked
      unanimously, dropped back out of range, and Hotchkiss retaliated with a
      spirited bang at the door with the tongs. This brought another bullet. It
      was a ridiculous situation. Under the circumstances, no doubt, we should
      have retired, at least until we had armed ourselves, but Hotchkiss had no
      end of fighting spirit, and as for me, my blood was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break the lock,&rdquo; I suggested, and Hotchkiss, standing at the side, out of
      range, retaliated for every bullet by a smashing blow with the tongs. The
      shots ceased after a half dozen, and the door was giving, slowly. One of
      us on each side of the door, we were ready for almost any kind of
      desperate resistance. As it swung open Hotchkiss poised the tongs; I
      stood, bent forward, my arm drawn back for a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a sound. Finally, at the risk of losing an eye which I
      justly value, I peered around and into the room. There was no desperado
      there: only a fresh-faced, trembling-lipped servant, sitting on the edge
      of her bed, with a quilt around her shoulders and the empty revolver at
      her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were victorious, but no conquered army ever beat such a retreat as ours
      down the tower stairs and into the refuge of the living-room. There, with
      the door closed, sprawled on the divan, I went from one spasm of mirth
      into another, becoming sane at intervals, and suffering relapse again
      every time I saw Hotchkiss' disgruntled countenance. He was pacing the
      room, the tongs still in his hand, his mouth pursed with irritation.
      Finally he stopped in front of me and compelled my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have finished cackling,&rdquo; he said with dignity, &ldquo;I wish to
      justify my position. Do you think the&mdash;er&mdash;young woman up-stairs
      put a pair of number eight boots to dry in the library last night? Do you
      think she poured the whisky out of that decanter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been known to do it,&rdquo; I put in, but his eye silenced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, if she had been the person who peered at you over the gallery
      railing last night, don't you suppose, with her&mdash;er&mdash;belligerent
      disposition, she could have filled you as full of lead as a window
      weight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;It wasn't Alice-sit-by-the-fire. I grant you that.
      Then who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss felt certain that it had been Sullivan, but I was not so sure.
      Why would he have crawled like a thief into his own house? If he had
      crossed the park, as seemed probable, when we did, he had not made any
      attempt to use the knocker. I gave it up finally, and made an effort to
      conciliate the young woman in the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had heard no sound since our spectacular entrance into her room. I was
      distinctly uncomfortable as, alone this time, I climbed to the tower
      staircase. Reasoning from before, she would probably throw a chair at me.
      I stopped at the foot of the staircase and called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello up there,&rdquo; I said, in as debonair a manner as I could summon. &ldquo;Good
      morning. Wie geht es bei ihen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon jour, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I tried again. This time there was a movement of
      some sort from above, but nothing fell on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;we want to apologize for rousing you so&mdash;er&mdash;unexpectedly
      this morning,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;The fact is, we wanted to talk to you, and you&mdash;you
      were hard to waken. We are travelers, lost in your mountains, and we crave
      a breakfast and an audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came to the door then. I could feel that she was investigating the top
      of my head from above. &ldquo;Is Mr. Sullivan with you?&rdquo; she asked. It was the
      first word from her, and she was not sure of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We are alone. If you will come down and look at us you will find us
      two perfectly harmless people, whose horse&mdash;curses on him&mdash;departed
      without leave last night and left us at your gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She relaxed somewhat then and came down a step or two. &ldquo;I was afraid I had
      killed somebody,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The housekeeper left yesterday, and the other
      maids went with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that I was comparatively young and lacked the earmarks of the
      highwayman, she was greatly relieved. She was inclined to fight shy of
      Hotchkiss, however, for some reason. She gave us a breakfast of a sort,
      for there was little in the house, and afterward we telephoned to the town
      for a vehicle. While Hotchkiss examined scratches and replaced the Bokhara
      rug, I engaged Jennie in conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;who is managing the estate since Mrs. Curtis
      was killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; she returned shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has&mdash;any member of the family been here since the accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. There was only the two, and some think Mr. Sullivan was killed
      as well as his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wheeled on me with quick suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a detective?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him to say you represented the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a lawyer. Some of them misrepresent the law, but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke in impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sheriff's officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Look here, Jennie; I am all that I should be. You'll have to believe
      that. And I'm in a bad position through no fault of my own. I want you to
      answer some questions. If you will help me, I will do what I can for you.
      Do you live near here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her chin quivered. It was the first sign of weakness she had shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My home is in Pittsburg,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I haven't enough money to get
      there. They hadn't paid any wages for two months. They didn't pay
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I'll send you back to Pittsburg, Pullman
      included, if you will tell me some things I want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She agreed eagerly. Outside the window Hotchkiss was bending over,
      examining footprints in the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;there has been a Miss West staying here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sullivan was attentive to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She was the granddaughter of a wealthy man in Pittsburg. My aunt has
      been in his family for twenty years. Mrs. Curtis wanted her brother to
      marry Miss West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he did marry her?&rdquo; I could not keep the excitement out of my
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There were reasons&rdquo;&mdash;she stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything of the family? Are they&mdash;were they New
      Yorkers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They came from somewhere in the south. I have heard Mrs. Curtis say her
      mother was a Cuban. I don't know much about them, but Mr. Sullivan had a
      wicked temper, though he didn't look it. Folks say big, light-haired
      people are easy going, but I don't believe it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long was Miss West here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated about further questioning. Critical as my position was, I
      could not pry deeper into Alison West's affairs. If she had got into the
      hands of adventurers, as Sullivan and his sister appeared to have been,
      she was safely away from them again. But something of the situation in the
      car Ontario was forming itself in my mind: the incident at the farmhouse
      lacked only motive to be complete. Was Sullivan, after all, a rascal or a
      criminal? Was the murderer Sullivan or Mrs. Conway? The lady or the tiger
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jennie was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Miss West was not hurt?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We liked her, all of us. She
      was not like Mrs. Curtis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to say that she was not like anybody in the world. Instead&mdash;&ldquo;She
      escaped with some bruises,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at my arm. &ldquo;You were on the train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited for more questions, but none coming, she went to the door. Then
      she closed it softly and came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Curtis is dead? You are sure of it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was killed instantly, I believe. The body was not recovered. But I
      have reasons for believing that Mr. Sullivan is living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think he was here the night before last.
      That is why I went to the tower room. I believe he would kill me if he
      could.&rdquo; As nearly as her round and comely face could express it, Jennie's
      expression was tragic at that moment. I made a quick resolution, and acted
      on it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not entirely frank with me, Jennie,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;And I am going
      to tell you more than I have. We are talking at cross purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the wrecked train, in the same car with Mrs. Curtis, Miss West
      and Mr. Sullivan. During the night there was a crime committed in that car
      and Mr. Sullivan disappeared. But he left behind him a chain of
      circumstantial evidence that involved me completely, so that I may, at any
      time, be arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently she did not comprehend for a moment. Then, as if the meaning of
      my words had just dawned on her, she looked up and gasped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;Mr. Sullivan committed the crime himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was murder,&rdquo; I said deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands clenched involuntarily, and she shrank back. &ldquo;A woman?&rdquo; She
      could scarcely form her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a man; a Mr. Simon Harrington, of Pittsburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her effort to retain her self-control was pitiful. Then she broke down and
      cried, her head on the back of a tall chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; she said wretchedly, &ldquo;my fault, I should not have sent
      them the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes she grew quiet. She seemed to hesitate over something,
      and finally determined to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand better, sir, when I say that I was raised in the
      Harrington family. Mr. Harrington was Mr. Sullivan's wife's father!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. AT THE STATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      So it had been the tiger, not the lady! Well, I had held to that theory
      all through. Jennie suddenly became a valuable person; if necessary she
      could prove the connection between Sullivan and the murdered man, and show
      a motive for the crime. I was triumphant when Hotchkiss came in. When the
      girl had produced a photograph of Mrs. Sullivan, and I had recognized the
      bronze-haired girl of the train, we were both well satisfied&mdash;which
      goes to prove the ephemeral nature of most human contentments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jennie either had nothing more to say, or feared she had said too much.
      She was evidently uneasy before Hotchkiss. I told her that Mrs. Sullivan
      was recovering in a Baltimore hospital, but she already knew it, from some
      source, and merely nodded. She made a few preparations for leaving, while
      Hotchkiss and I compared notes, and then, with the cat in her arms, she
      climbed into the trap from the town. I sat with her, and on the way down
      she told me a little, not much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see Mrs. Sullivan,&rdquo; she advised, &ldquo;and she is conscious, she
      probably thinks that both her husband and her father were killed in the
      wreck. She will be in a bad way, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that she&mdash;still cares about her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cat crawled over on to my knee, and rubbed its head against my hand
      invitingly. Jennie stared at the undulating line of the mountain crests, a
      colossal sun against a blue ocean of sky. &ldquo;Yes, she cares,&rdquo; she said
      softly. &ldquo;Women are made like that. They say they are cats, but Peter there
      in your lap wouldn't come back and lick your hand if you kicked him. If&mdash;if
      you have to tell her the truth, be as gentle as you can, sir. She has been
      good to me&mdash;that's why I have played the spy here all summer. It's a
      thankless thing, spying on people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that,&rdquo; I agreed soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss and I arrived in Washington late that evening, and, rather than
      arouse the household, I went to the club. I was at the office early the
      next morning and admitted myself. McKnight rarely appeared before half
      after ten, and our modest office force some time after nine. I looked over
      my previous day's mail and waited, with such patience as I possessed, for
      McKnight. In the interval I called up Mrs. Klopton and announced that I
      would dine at home that night. What my household subsists on during my
      numerous absences I have never discovered. Tea, probably, and crackers.
      Diligent search when I have made a midnight arrival, never reveals
      anything more substantial. Possibly I imagine it, but the announcement
      that I am about to make a journey always seems to create a general
      atmosphere of depression throughout the house, as though Euphemia and
      Eliza, and Thomas, the stableman, were already subsisting, in imagination,
      on Mrs. Klopton's meager fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I called her up and announced my arrival. There was something unusual
      in her tone, as though her throat was tense with indignation. Always
      shrill, her elderly voice rasped my ear painfully through the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have changed the butcher, Mr. Lawrence,&rdquo; she announced portentously.
      &ldquo;The last roast was a pound short, and his mutton-chops&mdash;any
      self-respecting sheep would refuse to acknowledge them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I said before, I can always tell from the voice in which Mrs. Klopton
      conveys the most indifferent matters, if something of real significance
      has occurred. Also, through long habit, I have learned how quickest to
      bring her to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pessimistic this morning,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;What's the matter, Mrs.
      Klopton? You haven't used that tone since Euphemia baked a pie for the
      iceman. What is it now? Somebody poison the dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house has been broken into, Mr. Lawrence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have lived in
      the best families, and never have I stood by and seen what I saw yesterday&mdash;every
      bureau drawer opened, and my&mdash;my most sacred belongings&mdash;&rdquo; she
      choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notify the police?&rdquo; I asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;Police! It was the police that did it&mdash;two
      detectives with a search warrant. I&mdash;I wouldn't dare tell you over
      the telephone what one of them said when he found the whisky and rock
      candy for my cough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they take anything?&rdquo; I demanded, every nerve on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took the cough medicine,&rdquo; she returned indignantly, &ldquo;and they said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the cough medicine!&rdquo; I was frantic. &ldquo;Did they take anything
      else? Were they in my dressing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I threatened to sue them, and I told them what you would do when you
      came back. But they wouldn't listen. They took away that black sealskin
      bag you brought home from Pittsburg with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew then that my hours of freedom were numbered. To have found Sullivan
      and then, in support of my case against him, to have produced the bag,
      minus the bit of chain, had been my intention. But the police had the bag,
      and, beyond knowing something of Sullivan's history, I was practically no
      nearer his discovery than before. Hotchkiss hoped he had his man in the
      house off Washington Circle, but on the very night he had seen him Jennie
      claimed that Sullivan had tried to enter the Laurels. Then&mdash;suppose
      we found Sullivan and proved the satchel and its contents his? Since the
      police had the bit of chain it might mean involving Alison in the story. I
      sat down and buried my face in my hands. There was no escape. I figured it
      out despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against me was the evidence of the survivors of the Ontario that I had
      been accused of the murder at the time. There had been blood-stains on my
      pillow and a hidden dagger. Into the bargain, in my possession had been
      found a traveling-bag containing the dead man's pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my favor was McKnight's theory against Mrs. Conway. She had a motive
      for wishing to secure the notes, she believed I was in lower ten, and she
      had collapsed at the discovery of the crime in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against both of these theories, I accuse a purely chimerical person named
      Sullivan, who was not seen by any of the survivors&mdash;save one, Alison,
      whom I could not bring into the case. I could find a motive for his
      murdering his father-in-law, whom he hated, but again&mdash;I would have
      to drag in the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not one of the theories explained the telegram and the broken
      necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the office force was arriving. They were comfortably ignorant of
      my presence, and over the transom floated scraps of dialogue and the
      stenographer's gurgling laugh. McKnight had a relative, who was reading
      law with him, in the intervals between calling up the young women of his
      acquaintance. He came in singing, and the office boy joined in with the
      uncertainty of voice of fifteen. I smiled grimly. I was too busy with my
      own troubles to find any joy in opening the door and startling them into
      silence. I even heard, without resentment, Blobs of the uncertain voice
      inquire when &ldquo;Blake&rdquo; would be back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped McKnight would arrive before the arrest occurred. There were many
      things to arrange. But when at last, impatient of his delay, I telephoned,
      I found he had been gone for more than an hour. Clearly he was not coming
      directly to the office, and with such resignation as I could muster I
      paced the floor and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt more alone than I have ever felt in my life. &ldquo;Born an orphan,&rdquo; as
      Richey said, I had made my own way, carved out myself such success as had
      been mine. I had built up my house of life on the props of law and order,
      and now some unknown hand had withdrawn the supports, and I stood among
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose it is the maternal in a woman that makes a man turn to her when
      everything else fails. The eternal boy in him goes to have his wounded
      pride bandaged, his tattered self-respect repaired. If he loves the woman,
      he wants her to kiss the hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longing to see Alison, always with me, was stronger than I was that
      morning. It might be that I would not see her again. I had nothing to say
      to her save one thing, and that, under the cloud that hung over me, I did
      not dare to say. But I wanted to see her, to touch her hand&mdash;as only
      a lonely man can crave it, I wanted the comfort of her, the peace that lay
      in her presence. And so, with every step outside the door a threat, I
      telephoned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone! The disappointment was great, for my need was great. In a
      fury of revolt against the scheme of things, I heard that she had started
      home to Richmond&mdash;but that she might still be caught at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see her had by that time become an obsession. I picked up my hat, threw
      open the door, and, oblivious of the shock to the office force of my
      presence, followed so immediately by my exit, I dashed out to the
      elevator. As I went down in one cage I caught a glimpse of Johnson and two
      other men going up in the next. I hardly gave them a thought. There was no
      hansom in sight, and I jumped on a passing car. Let come what might,
      arrest, prison, disgrace, I was going to see Alison.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw her. I flung into the station, saw that it was empty&mdash;empty,
      for she was not there. Then I hurried back to the gates. She was there, a
      familiar figure in blue, the very gown in which I always thought of her,
      the one she had worn when, Heaven help me&mdash;I had kissed her, at the
      Carter farm. And she was not alone. Bending over her, talking earnestly,
      with all his boyish heart in his face, was Richey.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not see me, and I was glad of it. After all, it had been
      McKnight's game first. I turned on my heel and made my way blindly out of
      the station. Before I lost them I turned once and looked toward them,
      standing apart from the crowd, absorbed in each other. They were the only
      two people on earth that I cared about, and I left them there together.
      Then I went back miserably to the office and awaited arrest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. ON TO RICHMOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, I was not disturbed that day. McKnight did not appear at
      all. I sat at my desk and transacted routine business all afternoon,
      working with feverish energy. Like a man on the verge of a critical
      illness or a hazardous journey, I cleared up my correspondence, paid bills
      until I had writer's cramp from signing checks, read over my will, and
      paid up my life insurance, made to the benefit of an elderly sister of my
      mother's. I no longer dreaded arrest. After that morning in the station, I
      felt that anything would be a relief from the tension. I went home with
      perfect openness, courting the warrant that I knew was waiting, but I was
      not molested. The delay puzzled me. The early part of the evening was
      uneventful. I read until late, with occasional lapses, when my book lay at
      my elbow, and I smoked and thought. Mrs. Klopton closed the house with
      ostentatious caution, about eleven, and hung around waiting to enlarge on
      the outrageousness of the police search. I did not encourage her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think,&rdquo; she concluded pompously, one foot in the hall, &ldquo;that
      you were something you oughtn't to be, Mr. Lawrence. They acted as though
      you had committed a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure that I didn't, Mrs. Klopton,&rdquo; I said wearily. &ldquo;Somebody did,
      the general verdict seems to point my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at me in speechless indignation. Then she flounced out. She
      came back once to say that the paper predicted cooler weather, and that
      she had put a blanket on my bed, but, to her disappointment, I refused to
      reopen the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half past eleven McKnight and Hotchkiss came in. Richey has a habit of
      stopping his car in front of the house and honking until some one comes
      out. He has a code of signals with the horn, which I never remember. Two
      long and a short blast mean, I believe, &ldquo;Send out a box of cigarettes,&rdquo;
       and six short blasts, which sound like a police call, mean &ldquo;Can you lend
      me some money?&rdquo; To-night I knew something was up, for he got out and rang
      the door-bell like a Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came into the library, and Hotchkiss wiped his collar until it
      gleamed. McKnight was aggressively cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not pinched yet!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you think of that for luck! You
      always were a fortunate devil, Lawrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I assented, with some bitterness, &ldquo;I hardly know how to contain
      myself for joy sometimes. I suppose you know&rdquo;&mdash;to Hotchkiss&mdash;&ldquo;that
      the police were here while we were at Cresson, and that they found the bag
      that I brought from the wreck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are coming to a head,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully &ldquo;unless a little plan
      that I have in mind&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so; I am pretty nearly desperate,&rdquo; I said doggedly. &ldquo;I've got a
      mental toothache, and the sooner it's pulled the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; said McKnight, &ldquo;think of the disgrace to the firm if its
      senior member goes up for life, or&mdash;&rdquo; he twisted his handkerchief
      into a noose, and went through an elaborate pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although jail isn't so bad, anyhow,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;there are fellows that
      get the habit and keep going back and going back.&rdquo; He looked at his watch,
      and I fancied his cheerfulness was strained. Hotchkiss was nervously
      fumbling my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever read The Purloined Letter, Mr. Blakeley?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, years ago,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Poe, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was choked at my indifference. &ldquo;It is a masterpiece,&rdquo; he said, with
      enthusiasm. &ldquo;I re-read it to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I inspected the rooms in the house off Washington Circle. I&mdash;I
      made some discoveries, Mr. Blakeley. For one thing, our man there is
      left-handed.&rdquo; He looked around for our approval. &ldquo;There was a small
      cushion on the dresser, and the scarf pins in it had been stuck in with
      the left hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody may have twisted the cushion,&rdquo; I objected, but he looked hurt,
      and I desisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one discrepancy,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but it troubles me.
      According to Mrs. Carter, at the farmhouse, our man wore gaudy pajamas,
      while I found here only the most severely plain night-shirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any buttons off?&rdquo; McKnight inquired, looking again at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The buttons were there,&rdquo; the amateur detective answered gravely, &ldquo;but the
      buttonhole next the top one was torn through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight winked at me furtively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced of one thing,&rdquo; Hotchkiss went on, clearing his throat,
      &ldquo;the papers are not in that room. Either he carries them with him, or he
      has sold them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sound on the street made both my visitors listen sharply. Whatever it
      was it passed on, however. I was growing curious and the restraint was
      telling on McKnight. He has no talent for secrecy. In the interval we
      discussed the strange occurrence at Cresson, which lost nothing by
      Hotchkiss' dry narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the woman in the Baltimore hospital is the wife
      of Henry Sullivan and the daughter of the man he murdered. No wonder he
      collapsed when he heard of the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joy, probably,&rdquo; McKnight put in. &ldquo;Is that clock right, Lawrence? Never
      mind, it doesn't matter. By the way, Mrs. Conway dropped in the office
      yesterday, while you were away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; I sprang from my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing. Said she had heard great things of us, and wanted us to
      handle her case against the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to know what she is driving at,&rdquo; I reflected. &ldquo;Is she trying
      to reach me through you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richey's flippancy is often a cloak for deeper feeling. He dropped it now.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she's after the notes, of course. And I'll tell you I
      felt like a poltroon&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;when I turned her
      down. She stood by the door with her face white, and told me
      contemptuously that I could save you from a murder charge and wouldn't do
      it. She made me feel like a cur. I was just as guilty as if I could have
      obliged her. She hinted that there were reasons and she laid my attitude
      to beastly motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; I said, as easily as I could. Hotchkiss had gone to the
      window. &ldquo;She was excited. There are no 'reasons,' whatever she means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richey put his hand on my shoulder. &ldquo;We've been together too long to let
      any 'reasons' or 'unreasons' come between us, old man,&rdquo; he said, not very
      steadily. Hotchkiss, who had been silent, here came forward in his most
      impressive manner. He put his hands under his coat-tails and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blakeley,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;by Mr. McKnight's advice we have arranged a
      little interview here to-night. If all has gone as I planned, Mr. Henry
      Pinckney Sullivan is by this time under arrest. Within a very few minutes&mdash;he
      will be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to talk to him before he was locked up,&rdquo; Richey explained. &ldquo;He's
      clever enough to be worth knowing, and, besides, I'm not so cocksure of
      his guilt as our friend the Patch on the Seat of Government. No murderer
      worthy of the name needs six different motives for the same crime,
      beginning with robbery, and ending with an unpleasant father-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were all silent for a while. McKnight stationed himself at a window,
      and Hotchkiss paced the floor expectantly. &ldquo;It's a great day for modern
      detective methods,&rdquo; he chirruped. &ldquo;While the police have been guarding
      houses and standing with their mouths open waiting for clues to fall in
      and choke them, we have pieced together, bit by bit, a fabric&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door-bell rang, followed immediately by sounds of footsteps in the
      hall. McKnight threw the door open, and Hotchkiss, raised on his toes,
      flung out his arm in a gesture of superb eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold&mdash;your man!&rdquo; he declaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open doorway came a tall, blond fellow, clad in light gray,
      wearing tan shoes, and followed closely by an officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought him here as you suggested, Mr. McKnight,&rdquo; said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But McKnight was doubled over the library table in silent convulsions of
      mirth, and I was almost as bad. Little Hotchkiss stood up, his important
      attitude finally changing to one of chagrin, while the blond man ceased to
      look angry, and became sheepish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Stuart, our confidential clerk for the last half dozen years!
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight sat up and wiped his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuart,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;there are two very serious things we have
      learned about you. First, you jab your scarf pins into your cushion with
      your left hand, which is most reprehensible; second, you wear&mdash;er&mdash;night-shirts,
      instead of pajamas. Worse than that, perhaps, we find that one of them has
      a buttonhole torn out at the neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stuart was bewildered. He looked from McKnight to me, and then at the
      crestfallen Hotchkiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any idea what it's all about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was arrested as I
      reached my boarding-house to-night, after the theater, and brought
      directly here. I told the officer it was a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hotchkiss tried bravely to justify the fiasco. &ldquo;You can not deny,&rdquo; he
      contended, &ldquo;that Mr. Andrew Bronson followed you to your rooms last Monday
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stuart looked at us and flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't deny it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there was nothing criminal about it,
      on my part, at least. Mr. Bronson has been trying to induce me to secure
      the forged notes for him. But I did not even know where they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were not on the wrecked Washington Flier?&rdquo; persisted Hotchkiss.
      But McKnight interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use trying to put the other man's identity on Stuart, Mr.
      Hotchkiss,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;He has been our confidential clerk for six
      years, and has not been away from the office a day for a year. I am afraid
      that the beautiful fabric we have pieced out of all these scraps is going
      to be a crazy quilt.&rdquo; His tone was facetious, but I could detect the
      undercurrent of real disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paid the constable for his trouble, and he departed. Stuart, still
      indignant, left to go back to Washington Circle. He shook hands with
      McKnight and myself magnanimously, but he hurled a look of utter hatred at
      Hotchkiss, sunk crestfallen in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can see,&rdquo; said McKnight dryly, &ldquo;we're exactly as far along as
      we were the day we met at the Carter place. We're not a step nearer to
      finding our man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have one thing that may be of value,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;He is the husband
      of a bronze-haired woman at Van Kirk's hospital, and it is just possible
      we may trace him through her. I hope we are not going to lose your
      valuable co-operation, Mr. Hotchkiss?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused at that to feeble interest, &ldquo;I&mdash;oh, of course not, if you
      still care to have me, I&mdash;I was wondering about&mdash;the man who
      just went out, Stuart, you say? I&mdash;told his landlady to-night that he
      wouldn't need the room again. I hope she hasn't rented it to somebody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We cheered him as best we could, and I suggested that we go to Baltimore
      the next day and try to find the real Sullivan through his wife. He left
      sometime after midnight, and Richey and I were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a chair near the lamp and lighted a cigarette, and for a time we
      were silent. I was in the shadow, and I sat back and watched him. It was
      not surprising, I thought, that she cared for him: women had always loved
      him, perhaps because he always loved them. There was no disloyalty in the
      thought: it was the lad's nature to give and crave affection. Only&mdash;I
      was different. I had never really cared about a girl before, and my life
      had been singularly loveless. I had fought a lonely battle always. Once
      before, in college, we had both laid ourselves and our callow devotions at
      the feet of the same girl. Her name was Dorothy&mdash;I had forgotten the
      rest&mdash;but I remembered the sequel. In a spirit of quixotic youth I
      had relinquished my claim in favor of Richey and had gone cheerfully on my
      way, elevated by my heroic sacrifice to a somber, white-hot martyrdom. As
      is often the case, McKnight's first words showed our parallel lines of
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Lollie,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do you remember Dorothy Browne?&rdquo; Browne, that
      was it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy Browne?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;why yes, I recall her now. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was thinking about her. That's all. You remember
      you were crazy about her, and dropped back because she preferred me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got out,&rdquo; I said with dignity, &ldquo;because you declared you would shoot
      yourself if she didn't go with you to something or other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why yes, I recall now!&rdquo; he mimicked. He tossed his cigarette in the
      general direction of the hearth and got up. We were both a little
      conscious, and he stood with his back to me, fingering a Japanese vase on
      the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; he began, turning the vase around, &ldquo;that, if you feel
      pretty well again, and&mdash;and ready to take hold, that I should like to
      go away for a week or so. Things are fairly well cleaned up at the
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;you are going to Richmond?&rdquo; I asked, after a scarcely
      perceptible pause. He turned and faced me, with his hands thrust in his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That's off, Lollie. The Sieberts are going for a week's cruise along
      the coast. I&mdash;the hot weather has played hob with me and the cruise
      means seven days' breeze and bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lighted a cigarette and offered him the box, but he refused. He was
      looking haggard and suddenly tired. I could not think of anything to say,
      and neither could he, evidently. The matter between us lay too deep for
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's Candida?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martin says a month, and she will be all right,&rdquo; I returned, in the same
      tone. He picked up his hat, but he had something more to say. He blurted
      it out, finally, half way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Seiberts are not going for a couple of days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if you
      want a day or so off to go down to Richmond yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I shall,&rdquo; I returned, as indifferently as I could. &ldquo;Not going
      yet, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is late.&rdquo; He drew in his breath as if he had something more to
      say, but the impulse passed. &ldquo;Well, good night,&rdquo; he said from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the outer door slammed and I heard the engine of the
      Cannonball throbbing in the street. Then the quiet settled down around me
      again, and there in the lamplight I dreamed dreams. I was going to see
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the idea of being shut away, even temporarily, from so great and
      wonderful a world became intolerable. The possibility of arrest before I
      could get to Richmond was hideous, the night without end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my escape the next morning through the stable back of the house,
      and then, by devious dark and winding ways, to the office. There, after a
      conference with Blobs, whose features fairly jerked with excitement, I
      double-locked the door of my private office and finished off some
      imperative work. By ten o'clock I was free, and for the twentieth time I
      consulted my train schedule. At five minutes after ten, with McKnight not
      yet in sight, Blobs knocked at the door, the double rap we had agreed
      upon, and on being admitted slipped in and quietly closed the door behind
      him. His eyes were glistening with excitement, and a purple dab of
      typewriter ink gave him a peculiarly villainous and stealthy expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two of 'em, and that crazy Stuart wasn't on, and
      said you were somewhere in the building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A door slammed outside, followed by steps on the uncarpeted outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said Blobs, in a husky undertone, and, darting into a
      lavatory, threw open a door that I had always supposed locked. Thence into
      a back hall piled high with boxes and past the presses of a bookbindery to
      the freight elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly to Blobs' disappointment, there was no pursuit. I was exhilarated
      but out of breath when we emerged into an alleyway, and the sharp daylight
      shone on Blobs' excited face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great sport, isn't it?&rdquo; I panted, dropping a dollar into his palm, inked
      to correspond with his face. &ldquo;Regular walk-away in the hundred-yard dash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme two dollars more and I'll drop 'em down the elevator shaft,&rdquo; he
      suggested ferociously. I left him there with his blood-thirsty schemes,
      and started for the station. I had a tendency to look behind me now and
      then, but I reached the station unnoticed. The afternoon was hot, the
      train rolled slowly along, stopping to pant at sweltering stations, from
      whose roofs the heat rose in waves. But I noticed these things
      objectively, not subjectively, for at the end of the journey was a girl
      with blue eyes and dark brown hair, hair that could&mdash;had I not seen
      it?&mdash;hang loose in bewitching tangles or be twisted into little coils
      of delight.

      CHAPTER XXVII. THE SEA, THE SAND, THE STARS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I telephoned as soon as I reached my hotel, and I had not known how much I
      had hoped from seeing her until I learned that she was out of town. I hung
      up the receiver, almost dizzy with disappointment, and it was fully five
      minutes before I thought of calling up again and asking if she was within
      telephone reach. It seemed she was down on the bay staying with the Samuel
      Forbeses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy Forbes! It was a name to conjure with just then. In the old days at
      college I had rather flouted him, but now I was ready to take him to my
      heart. I remembered that he had always meant well, anyhow, and that he was
      explosively generous. I called him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the fumes of gasoline!&rdquo; he said, when I told him who I was. &ldquo;Blakeley,
      the Fount of Wisdom against Woman! Blakeley, the Great Unkissed! Welcome
      to our city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he proceeded to urge me to come down to the Shack, and to say
      that I was an agreeable surprise, because four times in two hours youths
      had called up to ask if Alison West was stopping with him, and to suggest
      that they had a vacant day or two. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Miss West!&rdquo; I shouted
      politely. There was a buzzing on the line. &ldquo;Is she there?&rdquo; Sam had no
      suspicions. Was not I in his mind always the Great Unkissed?&mdash;which
      sounds like the Great Unwashed and is even more of a reproach. He asked me
      down promptly, as I had hoped, and thrust aside my objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bring yourself. The lady that keeps my
      boarding-house is calling to me to insist. You remember Dorothy, don't
      you, Dorothy Browne? She says unless you have lost your figure you can
      wear my clothes all right. All you need here is a bathing suit for daytime
      and a dinner coat for evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds cool,&rdquo; I temporized. &ldquo;If you are sure I won't put you out&mdash;very
      well, Sam, since you and your wife are good enough. I have a couple of
      days free. Give my love to Dorothy until I can do it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam met me himself and drove me out to the Shack, which proved to be a
      substantial house overlooking the water. On the way he confided to me that
      lots of married men thought they were contented when they were merely
      resigned, but that it was the only life, and that Sam, Junior, could swim
      like a duck. Incidentally, he said that Alison was his wife's cousin,
      their respective grandmothers having, at proper intervals, married the
      same man, and that Alison would lose her good looks if she was not
      careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say she's worried, and I stick to it,&rdquo; he said, as he threw the lines
      to a groom and prepared to get out. &ldquo;You know her, and she's the kind of
      girl you think you can read like a book. But you can't; don't fool
      yourself. Take a good look at her at dinner, Blake; you won't lose your
      head like the other fellows&mdash;and then tell me what's wrong with her.
      We're mighty fond of Allie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went ponderously up the steps, for Sam had put on weight since I knew
      him. At the door he turned around. &ldquo;Do you happen to know the MacLures at
      Seal Harbor?&rdquo; he asked irrelevantly, but Mrs. Sam came into the hall just
      then, both hands out to greet me, and, whatever Forbes had meant to say,
      he did not pick up the subject again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are having tea in here,&rdquo; Dorothy said gaily, indicating the door
      behind her. &ldquo;Tea by courtesy, because I think tea is the only beverage
      that isn't represented. And then we must dress, for this is hop night at
      the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is as great a misnomer as the tea,&rdquo; Sam put in, ponderously
      struggling out of his linen driving coat. &ldquo;It's bridge night, and the only
      hops are in the beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still gurgling over this as he took me upstairs. He showed me my
      room himself, and then began the fruitless search for evening raiment that
      kept me home that night from the club. For I couldn't wear Sam's clothes.
      That was clear, after a perspiring seance of a half hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't do it, Sam,&rdquo; I said, when I had draped his dress-coat on me toga
      fashion. &ldquo;Who am I to have clothing to spare, like this, when many a poor
      chap hasn't even a cellar door to cover him. I won't do it; I'm selfish,
      but not that selfish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; he said, wiping his face, &ldquo;how you've kept your figure! I can't
      wear a belt any more; got to have suspenders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected over his grievance for some time, sitting on the side of the
      bed. &ldquo;You could go as you are,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;We do it all the time,
      only to-night happens to be the annual something or other, and&mdash;&rdquo; he
      trailed off into silence, trying to buckle my belt around him. &ldquo;A good six
      inches,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I never get into a hansom cab any more that I don't
      expect to see the horse fly up into the air. Well, Allie isn't going
      either. She turned down Granger this afternoon, the Annapolis fellow you
      met on the stairs, pigeon-breasted chap&mdash;and she always gets a
      headache on those occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up heavily and went to the door. &ldquo;Granger is leaving,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      may be able to get his dinner coat for you. How well do you know her?&rdquo; he
      asked, with his hand on the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Dolly&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly well,&rdquo; I said cautiously. &ldquo;Not as well as I would like to. I dined
      with her last week in Washington. And&mdash;I knew her before that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forbes touched the bell instead of going out, and told the servant who
      answered to see if Mr. Granger's suitcase had gone. If not, to bring it
      across the hall. Then he came back to his former position on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we feel responsible for Allie&mdash;near relation and all that,&rdquo;
       he began pompously. &ldquo;And we can't talk to the people here at the house&mdash;all
      the men are in love with her, and all the women are jealous. Then&mdash;there's
      a lot of money, too, or will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the money!&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;That is&mdash;nothing. Razor slipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;because you don't lose your head over every
      pretty face&mdash;although Allie is more than that, of course. But about a
      month ago she went away&mdash;to Seal Harbor, to visit Janet MacLure. Know
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came home to Richmond yesterday, and then came down here&mdash;Allie,
      I mean. And yesterday afternoon Dolly had a letter from Janet&mdash;something
      about a second man&mdash;and saying she was disappointed not to have had
      Alison there, that she had promised them a two weeks' visit! What do you
      make of that? And that isn't the worst. Allie herself wasn't in the room,
      but there were eight other women, and because Dolly had put belladonna in
      her eyes the night before to see how she would look, and as a result
      couldn't see anything nearer than across the room, some one read the
      letter aloud to her, and the whole story is out. One of the cats told
      Granger and the boy proposed to Allie to-day, to show her he didn't care a
      tinker's dam where she had been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; I said, with enthusiasm. I liked the Granger fellow&mdash;since
      he was out of the running. But Sam was looking at me with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I didn't know you for what you are, I'd say you were
      interested there yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being so near her, under the same roof, with even the tie of a dubious
      secret between us, was making me heady. I pushed Forbes toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I interested!&rdquo; I retorted, holding him by the shoulders. &ldquo;There isn't a
      word in your vocabulary to fit my condition. I am an island in a sunlit
      sea of emotion, Sam, a&mdash;an empty place surrounded by longing&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An empty place surrounded by longing!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;You want your
      dinner, that's what's the matter with you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shut the door on him then. He seemed suddenly sordid. Dinner, I thought!
      Although, as matter of fact, I made a very fair meal when, Granger's
      suitcase not having gone, in his coat and some other man's trousers, I was
      finally fit for the amenities. Alison did not come down to dinner, so it
      was clear she would not go over to the club-house dance. I pled my injured
      arm and a ficticious, vaguely located sprain from the wreck, as an excuse
      for remaining at home. Sam regaled the table with accounts of my distrust
      of women, my one love affair&mdash;with Dorothy; to which I responded, as
      was expected, that only my failure there had kept me single all these
      years, and that if Sam should be mysteriously missing during the bathing
      hour to-morrow, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the endless meal was over, and yards of white veils had been tied
      over pounds of hair&mdash;or is it, too, bought by the yard?&mdash;and
      some eight ensembles with their abject complements had been packed into
      three automobiles and a trap, I drew a long breath and faced about. I had
      just then only one object in life&mdash;to find Alison, to assure her of
      my absolute faith and confidence in her, and to offer my help and my poor
      self, if she would let me, in her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not easy to find. I searched the lower floor, the verandas and the
      grounds, circumspectly. Then I ran into a little English girl who turned
      out to be her maid, and who also was searching. She was concerned because
      her mistress had had no dinner, and because the tray of food she carried
      would soon be cold. I took the tray from her, on the glimpse of something
      white on the shore, and that was how I met the Girl again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting on an over-turned boat, her chin in her hands, staring out
      to sea. The soft tide of the bay lapped almost at her feet, and the
      draperies of her white gown melted hazily into the sands. She looked like
      a wraith, a despondent phantom of the sea, although the adjective is
      redundant. Nobody ever thinks of a cheerful phantom. Strangely enough,
      considering her evident sadness, she was whistling softly to herself, over
      and over, some dreary little minor air that sounded like a Bohemian dirge.
      She glanced up quickly when I made a misstep and my dishes jingled. All
      considered, the tray was out of the picture: the sea, the misty starlight,
      the girl, with her beauty&mdash;even the sad little whistle that stopped
      now and then to go bravely on again, as though it fought against the odds
      of a trembling lip. And then I came, accompanied by a tray of little
      silver dishes that jingled and an unmistakable odor of broiled chicken!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said quickly; and then, &ldquo;Oh! I thought you were Jenkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timeo Danaos&mdash;what's the rest of it?&rdquo; I asked, tendering my
      offering. &ldquo;You didn't have any dinner, you know.&rdquo; I sat down beside her.
      &ldquo;See, I'll be the table. What was the old fairy tale? 'Little goat bleat:
      little table appear!' I'm perfectly willing to be the goat, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was laughing rather tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never do meet like other people, do we?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We really ought
      to shake hands and say how are you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to meet you like other people, and I suppose you always
      think of me as wearing the other fellow's clothes,&rdquo; I returned meekly.
      &ldquo;I'm doing it again: I don't seem to be able to help it. These are
      Granger's that I have on now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw back her head and laughed again, joyously, this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's so ridiculous,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you have never seen me when I was
      not eating! It's too prosaic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which reminds me that the chicken is getting cold, and the ice warm,&rdquo; I
      suggested. &ldquo;At the time, I thought there could be no place better than the
      farmhouse kitchen&mdash;but this is. I ordered all this for something I
      want to say to you&mdash;the sea, the sand, the stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How alliterative you are!&rdquo; she said, trying to be flippant. &ldquo;You are not
      to say anything until I have had my supper. Look how the things are
      spilled around!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she ate nothing, after all, and pretty soon I put the tray down in the
      sand. I said little; there was no hurry. We were together, and time meant
      nothing against that age-long wash of the sea. The air blew her hair in
      small damp curls against her face, and little by little the tide
      retreated, leaving our boat an oasis in a waste of gray sand.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year
  Do you suppose, the walrus said, that they could get it clear?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      she threw at me once when she must have known I was going to speak. I held
      her hand, and as long as I merely held it she let it lie warm in mine. But
      when I raised it to my lips, and kissed the soft, open palm, she drew it
      away without displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that, please,&rdquo; she protested, and fell to whistling softly again, her
      chin in her hands. &ldquo;I can't sing,&rdquo; she said, to break an awkward pause,
      &ldquo;and so, when I'm fidgety, or have something on my mind, I whistle. I hope
      you don't dislike it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; I asserted warmly. I did; when she pursed her lips like that
      I was mad to kiss them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you&mdash;at the station,&rdquo; she said, suddenly. &ldquo;You&mdash;you were
      in a hurry to go.&rdquo; I did not say anything, and after a pause she drew a
      long breath. &ldquo;Men are queer, aren't they?&rdquo; she said, and fell to whistling
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while she sat up as if she had made a resolution. &ldquo;I am going to
      confess something,&rdquo; she announced suddenly. &ldquo;You said, you know, that you
      had ordered all this for something you&mdash;you wanted to say to me. But
      the fact is, I fixed it all&mdash;came here, I mean, because&mdash;I knew
      you would come, and I had something to tell you. It was such a miserable
      thing I&mdash;needed the accessories to help me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to hear anything that distresses you to tell,&rdquo; I assured
      her. &ldquo;I didn't come here to force your confidence, Alison. I came because
      I couldn't help it.&rdquo; She did not object to my use of her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you found&mdash;your papers?&rdquo; she asked, looking directly at me for
      almost the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. We hope to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;police have not interfered with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven't had any opportunity,&rdquo; I equivocated. &ldquo;You needn't distress
      yourself about that, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do. I wonder why you still believe in me? Nobody else does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;why I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you produce Harry Sullivan,&rdquo; she was saying, partly to herself, &ldquo;and
      if you could connect him with Mr. Bronson, and get a full account of why
      he was on the train, and all that, it&mdash;it would help, wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged that it would. Now that the whole truth was almost in my
      possession, I was stricken with the old cowardice. I did not want to know
      what she might tell me. The yellow line on the horizon, where the moon was
      coming up, was a broken bit of golden chain: my heel in the sand was again
      pressed on a woman's yielding fingers: I pulled myself together with a
      jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order that what you might tell me may help me, if it will,&rdquo; I said
      constrainedly, &ldquo;it would be necessary, perhaps, that you tell it to the
      police. Since they have found the end of the necklace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of the necklace!&rdquo; she repeated slowly. &ldquo;What about the end of the
      necklace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at her. &ldquo;Don't you remember&rdquo;&mdash;I leaned forward&mdash;&ldquo;the
      end of the cameo necklace, the part that was broken off, and was found in
      the black sealskin bag, stained with&mdash;with blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; she said dully. &ldquo;You mean that you found the broken end? And then&mdash;you
      had my gold pocket-book, and you saw the necklace in it, and you&mdash;must
      have thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think anything,&rdquo; I hastened to assure her. &ldquo;I tell you, Alison,
      I never thought of anything but that you were unhappy, and that I had no
      right to help you. God knows, I thought you didn't want me to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand to me and I took it between both of mine. No word of
      love had passed between us, but I felt that she knew and understood. It
      was one of the moments that come seldom in a lifetime, and then only in
      great crises, a moment of perfect understanding and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she drew her hand away and sat, erect and determined, her fingers
      laced in her lap. As she talked the moon came up slowly and threw its
      bright pathway across the water. Back of us, in the trees beyond the sea
      wall, a sleepy bird chirruped drowsily, and a wave, larger and bolder than
      its brothers, sped up the sand, bringing the moon's silver to our very
      feet. I bent toward the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to ask just one question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you like.&rdquo; Her voice was almost dreary. &ldquo;Was it because of
      anything you are going to tell me that you refused Richey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her breath in sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, without looking at me. &ldquo;No. That was not the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. ALISON'S STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      She told her story evenly, with her eyes on the water, only now and then,
      when I, too, sat looking seaward, I thought she glanced at me furtively.
      And once, in the middle of it, she stopped altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't realize it, probably,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;but you look like a&mdash;a
      war god. Your face is horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will turn my back, if it will help any,&rdquo; I said stormily, &ldquo;but if you
      expect me to look anything but murderous, why, you don't know what I am
      going through with. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story of her meeting with the Curtis woman was brief enough. They had
      met in Rome first, where Alison and her mother had taken a villa for a
      year. Mrs. Curtis had hovered on the ragged edges of society there,
      pleading the poverty of the south since the war as a reason for not going
      out more. There was talk of a brother, but Alison had not seen him, and
      after a scandal which implicated Mrs. Curtis and a young attache of the
      Austrian embassy, Alison had been forbidden to see the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women had never liked her, anyhow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She did unconventional
      things, and they are very conventional there. And they said she did not
      always pay her&mdash;her gambling debts. I didn't like them. I thought
      they didn't like her because she was poor&mdash;and popular. Then&mdash;we
      came home, and I almost forgot her, but last spring, when mother was not
      well&mdash;she had taken grandfather to the Riviera, and it always uses
      her up&mdash;we went to Virginia Hot Springs, and we met them there, the
      brother, too, this time. His name was Sullivan, Harry Pinckney Sullivan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother had a nurse, and I was alone a great deal, and they were very kind
      to me. I&mdash;I saw a lot of them. The brother rather attracted me,
      partly&mdash;partly because he did not make love to me. He even seemed to
      avoid me, and I was piqued. I had been spoiled, I suppose. Most of the
      other men I knew had&mdash;had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, too,&rdquo; I said bitterly, and moved away from her a trifle. I
      was brutal, but the whole story was a long torture. I think she knew what
      I was suffering, for she showed no resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was early and there were few people around&mdash;none that I cared
      about. And mother and the nurse played cribbage eternally, until I felt as
      though the little pegs were driven into my brain. And when Mrs. Curtis
      arranged drives and picnics, I&mdash;I slipped away and went. I suppose
      you won't believe me, but I had never done that kind of thing before, and
      I&mdash;well, I have paid up, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of looking chap was Sullivan?&rdquo; I demanded. I had got up and was
      pacing back and forward on the sand. I remember kicking savagely at a bit
      of water-soaked board that lay in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very handsome&mdash;as large as you are, but fair, and even more erect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew my shoulders up sharply. I am straight enough, but I was fairly
      sagging with jealous rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When mother began to get around, somebody told her that I had been going
      about with Mrs. Curtis and her brother, and we had a dreadful time. I was
      dragged home like a bad child. Did anybody ever do that to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever cared. I was born an orphan,&rdquo; I said, with a cheerless
      attempt at levity. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mrs. Curtis knew, she never said anything. She wrote me charming
      letters, and in the summer, when they went to Cresson, she asked me to
      visit her there. I was too proud to let her know that I could not go where
      I wished, and so&mdash;I sent Polly, my maid, to her aunt's in the
      country, pretended to go to Seal Harbor, and really went to Cresson. You
      see I warned you it would be an unpleasant story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went over and stood in front of her. All the accumulated jealousy of the
      last few weeks had been fired by what she told me. If Sullivan had come
      across the sands just then, I think I would have strangled him with my
      hands, out of pure hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you marry him?&rdquo; I demanded. My voice sounded hoarse and strange in my
      ears. &ldquo;That's all I want to know. Did you marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;cared about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I did not care about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on the edge of the boat and mopped my hot face. I was heartily
      ashamed of myself, and mingled with my abasement was a great relief. If
      she had not married him, and had not cared for him, nothing else was of
      any importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sorry, of course, the moment the train had started, but I had wired
      I was coming, and I could not go back, and then when I got there, the
      place was charming. There were no neighbors, but we fished and rode and
      motored, and&mdash;it was moonlight, like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand over both of hers, clasped in her lap. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I
      acknowledged repentantly, &ldquo;and&mdash;people do queer things when it is
      moonlight. The moon has got me to-night, Alison. If I am a boor, remember
      that, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers lay quiet under mine. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she went on with a little
      sigh, &ldquo;I began to think perhaps I cared. But all the time I felt that
      there was something not quite right. Now and then Mrs. Curtis would say or
      do something that gave me a queer start, as if she had dropped a mask for
      a moment. And there was trouble with the servants; they were almost
      insolent. I couldn't understand. I don't know when it dawned on me that
      the old Baron Cavalcanti had been right when he said they were not my kind
      of people. But I wanted to get away, wanted it desperately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, they were not your kind,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;The man was married! The
      girl Jennie, a housemaid, was a spy in Mrs. Sullivan's employ. If he had
      pretended to marry you I would have killed him! Not only that, but the man
      he murdered, Harrington, was his wife's father. And I'll see him hang by
      the neck yet if it takes every energy and every penny I possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could have told her so much more gently, have broken the shock for her;
      I have never been proud of that evening on the sand. I was alternately a
      boor and a ruffian&mdash;like a hurt youngster who passes the blow that
      has hurt him on to his playmate, that both may bawl together. And now
      Alison sat, white and cold, without speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; she said finally, in a small voice. &ldquo;Why, I don't think it is
      possible, is it? I&mdash;I was on my way to Baltimore to marry him myself,
      when the wreck came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said you didn't care for him!&rdquo; I protested, my heavy masculine
      mind unable to jump the gaps in her story. And then, without the slightest
      warning, I realized that she was crying. She shook off my hand and fumbled
      for her handkerchief, and failing to find it, she accepted the one I
      thrust into her wet fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, little by little, she told me from the handkerchief, a sordid story
      of a motor trip in the mountains without Mrs. Curtis, of a lost road and a
      broken car, and a rainy night when they&mdash;she and Sullivan, tramped
      eternally and did not get home. And of Mrs. Curtis, when they got home at
      dawn, suddenly grown conventional and deeply shocked. Of her own proud,
      half-disdainful consent to make possible the hackneyed compromising
      situation by marrying the rascal, and then&mdash;of his disappearance from
      the train. It was so terrible to her, such a Heaven-sent relief to me, in
      spite of my rage against Sullivan, that I laughed aloud. At which she
      looked at me over the handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it's funny,&rdquo; she said, with a catch in her breath. &ldquo;When I think
      that I nearly married a murderer&mdash;and didn't&mdash;I cry for sheer
      joy.&rdquo; Then she buried her face and cried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't,&rdquo; I protested unsteadily. &ldquo;I won't be responsible if you
      keep on crying like that. I may forget that I have a capital charge
      hanging over my head, and that I may be arrested at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That brought her out of the handkerchief at once. &ldquo;I meant to be so
      helpful,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I've thought of nothing but myself! There were
      some things I meant to tell you. If Jennie was&mdash;what you say, then I
      understand why she came to me just before I left. She had been packing my
      things and she must have seen what condition I was in, for she came over
      to me when I was getting my wraps on, to leave, and said, 'Don't do it,
      Miss West, I beg you won't do it; you'll be sorry ever after.' And just
      then Mrs. Curtis came in and Jennie slipped out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As we went through the station the telegraph operator gave Har&mdash;Mr.
      Sullivan a message. He read it on the platform, and it excited him
      terribly. He took his sister aside and they talked together. He was white
      with either fear or anger&mdash;I don't know which. Then, when we boarded
      the train, a woman in black, with beautiful hair, who was standing on the
      car platform, touched him on the arm and then drew back. He looked at her
      and glanced away again, but she reeled as if he had struck her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; The situation was growing clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Curtis and I had the drawing-room. I had a dreadful night, just
      sleeping a little now and then. I dreaded to see dawn come. It was to be
      my wedding-day. When we found Harry had disappeared in the night, Mrs.
      Curtis was in a frenzy. Then&mdash;I saw his cigarette case in your hand.
      I had given it to him. You wore his clothes. The murder was discovered and
      you were accused of it! What could I do? And then, afterward, when I saw
      him asleep at the farmhouse, I&mdash;I was panic-stricken. I locked him in
      and ran. I didn't know why he did it, but&mdash;he had killed a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one was calling Alison through a megaphone, from the veranda. It
      sounded like Sam. &ldquo;All-ee,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;All-ee! I'm going to have some
      anchovies on toast! All-ee!&rdquo; Neither of us heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; I reflected, &ldquo;if you would be willing to repeat a part of that
      story&mdash;just from the telegram on&mdash;to a couple of detectives, say
      on Monday. If you would tell that, and&mdash;how the end of your necklace
      got into the sealskin bag&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My necklace!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;But it isn't mine. I picked it up in the
      car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All-ee!&rdquo; Sam again. &ldquo;I see you down there. I'm making a julep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alison turned and called through her hands. &ldquo;Coming in a moment, Sam,&rdquo; she
      said, and rose. &ldquo;It must be very late: Sam is home. We would better go
      back to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; I begged her. &ldquo;Anchovies and juleps and Sam will go on for ever,
      and I have you such a little time. I suppose I am only one of a dozen or
      so, but&mdash;you are the only girl in the world. You know I love you,
      don't you, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was whistling, an irritating bird call, over and over. She pursed her
      red lips and answered him in kind. It was more than I could endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam or no Sam,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;I am going to kiss you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sam's voice came strident through the megaphone. &ldquo;Be good, you two,&rdquo;
       he bellowed, &ldquo;I've got the binoculars!&rdquo; And so, under fire, we walked
      sedately back to the house. My pulses were throbbing&mdash;the little
      swish of her dress beside me on the grass was pain and ecstasy. I had but
      to put out my hand to touch her, and I dared not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, armed with a megaphone and field glasses, bent over the rail and
      watched us with gleeful malignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home early, aren't you?&rdquo; Alison called, when we reached the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Led a club when my partner had doubled no-trumps, and she fainted. Damn
      the heart convention!&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;The others are not here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later I went up to bed. I had not seen Alison alone again. The
      noise was at its height below, and I glanced down into the garden, still
      bright in the moonlight. Leaning against a tree, and staring interestedly
      into the billiard room, was Johnson.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. IN THE DINING-ROOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      That was Saturday night, two weeks after the wreck. The previous five days
      had been full of swift-following events&mdash;the woman in the house next
      door, the picture in the theater of a man about to leap from the doomed
      train, the dinner at the Dallases', and Richey's discovery that Alison was
      the girl in the case. In quick succession had come our visit to the Carter
      place, the finding of the rest of the telegram, my seeing Alison there,
      and the strange interview with Mrs. Conway. The Cresson trip stood out in
      my memory for its serio-comic horrors and its one real thrill. Then&mdash;the
      discovery by the police of the seal-skin bag and the bit of chain;
      Hotchkiss producing triumphantly Stuart for Sullivan and his subsequent
      discomfiture; McKnight at the station with Alison, and later the
      confession that he was out of the running.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, when I thought it all over, the entire week and its events were
      two sides of a triangle that was narrowing rapidly to an apex, a point.
      And the said apex was at that moment in the drive below my window, resting
      his long legs by sitting on a carriage block, and smoking a pipe that made
      the night hideous. The sense of the ridiculous is very close to the sense
      of tragedy. I opened my screen and whistled, and Johnson looked up and
      grinned. We said nothing. I held up a handful of cigars, he extended his
      hat, and when I finally went to sleep, it was to a soothing breeze that
      wafted in salt air and a faint aroma of good tobacco. I was thoroughly
      tired, but I slept restlessly, dreaming of two detectives with Pittsburg
      warrants being held up by Hotchkiss at the point of a splint, while Alison
      fastened their hands with a chain that was broken and much too short. I
      was roused about dawn by a light rap at the door, and, opening it, I found
      Forbes, in a pair of trousers and a pajama coat. He was as pleasant as
      most fleshy people are when they have to get up at night, and he said the
      telephone had been ringing for an hour, and he didn't know why somebody
      else in the blankety-blank house couldn't have heard it. He wouldn't get
      to sleep until noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was palpably asleep on his feet, I left him grumbling and went to
      the telephone. It proved to be Richey, who had found me by the simple
      expedient of tracing Alison, and he was jubilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to come back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Got a railroad schedule there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't sleep with one in my pocket,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;but if you'll hold the
      line I'll call out the window to Johnson. He's probably got one.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnson!&rdquo; I could hear the laugh with which McKnight comprehended the
      situation. He was still chuckling when I came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Train to Richmond at six-thirty A.M.,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What time is it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four. Listen, Lollie. We've got him. Do you hear? Through the woman at
      Baltimore. Then the other woman, the lady of the restaurant&rdquo;&mdash;he was
      obviously avoiding names&mdash;&ldquo;she is playing our cards for us. No&mdash;I
      don't know why, and I don't care. But you be at the Incubator to-night at
      eight o'clock. If you can't shake Johnson, bring him, bless him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this day I believe the Sam Forbeses have not recovered from the
      surprise of my unexpected arrival, my one appearance at dinner in
      Granger's clothes, and the note on my dresser which informed them the next
      morning that I had folded my tents like the Arabs and silently stole away.
      For at half after five Johnson and I, the former as uninquisitive as ever,
      were on our way through the dust to the station, three miles away, and by
      four that afternoon we were in Washington. The journey had been
      uneventful. Johnson relaxed under the influence of my tobacco, and spoke
      at some length on the latest improvements in gallows, dilating on the
      absurdity of cutting out the former free passes to see the affair in
      operation. I remember, too, that he mentioned the curious anomaly that
      permits a man about to be hanged to eat a hearty meal. I did not enjoy my
      dinner that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we got into Washington I had made an arrangement with Johnson to
      surrender myself at two the following afternoon. Also, I had wired to
      Alison, asking her if she would carry out the contract she had made. The
      detective saw me home, and left me there. Mrs. Klopton received me with
      dignified reserve. The very tone in which she asked me when I would dine
      told me that something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;what is it, Mrs. Klopton?&rdquo; I demanded finally, when she had
      informed me, in a patient and long-suffering tone, that she felt worn out
      and thought she needed a rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I lived with Mr. Justice Springer,&rdquo; she began acidly, her
      mending-basket in her hands, &ldquo;it was an orderly, well-conducted household.
      You can ask any of the neighbors. Meals were cooked and, what's more, they
      were eaten; there was none of this 'here one day and gone the next'
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;You're tired, that's all, Mrs. Klopton. And I
      wish you would go out; I want to bathe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not all,&rdquo; she said with dignity, from the doorway. &ldquo;Women coming
      and going here, women whose shoes I am not fit&mdash;I mean, women who are
      not fit to touch my shoes&mdash;coming here as insolent as you please, and
      asking for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;What did you tell them&mdash;her, whichever
      it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told her you were sick in a hospital and wouldn't be out for a year!&rdquo; she
      said triumphantly. &ldquo;And when she said she thought she'd come in and wait
      for you, I slammed the door on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time was she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Late last night. And she had a light-haired man across the street. If she
      thought I didn't see him, she don't know me.&rdquo; Then she closed the door and
      left me to my bath and my reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five minutes before eight I was at the Incubator, where I found
      Hotchkiss and McKnight. They were bending over a table, on which lay
      McKnight's total armament&mdash;a pair of pistols, an elephant gun and an
      old cavalry saber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw up a chair and help yourself to pie,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the
      arsenal. &ldquo;This is for the benefit of our friend Hotchkiss here, who says
      he is a small man and fond of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss, who had been trying to get the wrong end of a cartridge into
      the barrel of one of the revolvers, straightened himself and mopped his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have desperate people to handle,&rdquo; he said pompously, &ldquo;and we may need
      desperate means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotchkiss is like the small boy whose one ambition was to have people
      grow ashen and tremble at the mention of his name,&rdquo; McKnight jibed. But
      they were serious enough, both of them, under it all, and when they had
      told me what they planned, I was serious, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're compounding a felony,&rdquo; I remonstrated, when they had explained.
      &ldquo;I'm not eager to be locked away, but, by Jove, to offer her the stolen
      notes in exchange for Sullivan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't got either of them, you know,&rdquo; McKnight remonstrated, &ldquo;and we
      won't have, if we don't start. Come along, Fido,&rdquo; to Hotchkiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was simplicity itself. According to Hotchkiss, Sullivan was to
      meet Bronson at Mrs. Conway's apartment, at eight-thirty that night, with
      the notes. He was to be paid there and the papers destroyed. &ldquo;But just
      before that interesting finale,&rdquo; McKnight ended, &ldquo;we will walk in, take
      the notes, grab Sullivan, and give the police a jolt that will put them
      out of the count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose not one of us, slewing around corners in the machine that night,
      had the faintest doubt that we were on the right track, or that Fate,
      scurvy enough before, was playing into our hands at last. Little Hotchkiss
      was in a state of fever; he alternately twitched and examined the
      revolver, and a fear that the two movements might be synchronous kept me
      uneasy. He produced and dilated on the scrap of pillow slip from the
      wreck, and showed me the stiletto, with its point in cotton batting for
      safekeeping. And in the intervals he implored Richey not to make such fine
      calculations at the corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all grave enough and very quiet, however, when we reached the
      large building where Mrs. Conway had her apartment. McKnight left the
      power on, in case we might want to make a quick get-away, and Hotchkiss
      gave a final look at the revolver. I had no weapon. Somehow it all seemed
      melodramatic to the verge of farce. In the doorway Hotchkiss was a half
      dozen feet ahead; Richey fell back beside me. He dropped his affectation
      of gayety, and I thought he looked tired. &ldquo;Same old Sam, I suppose?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same, only more of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Alison was there? How is she?&rdquo; he inquired irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I did not see her this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss was waiting near the elevator. McKnight put his hand on my arm.
      &ldquo;Now, look here, old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I've got two arms and a revolver, and
      you've got one arm and a splint. If Hotchkiss is right, and there is a
      row, you crawl under a table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce I will!&rdquo; I declared scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      We crowded out of the elevator at the fourth floor, and found ourselves in
      a rather theatrical hallway of draperies and armor. It was very quiet; we
      stood uncertainly after the car had gone, and looked at the two or three
      doors in sight. They were heavy, covered with metal, and sound proof. From
      somewhere above came the metallic accuracy of a player-piano, and through
      the open window we could hear&mdash;or feel&mdash;the throb of the
      Cannonball's engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sherlock,&rdquo; McKnight said, &ldquo;what's the next move in the game? Is it
      our jump, or theirs? You brought us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of us knew just what to do next. No sound of conversation penetrated
      the heavy doors. We waited uneasily for some minutes, and Hotchkiss looked
      at his watch. Then he put it to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his head cocked on one side, &ldquo;I believe it
      has stopped. I'm afraid we are late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were late. My watch and Hotchkiss' agreed at nine o clock, and, with
      the discovery that our man might have come and gone, our zest in the
      adventure began to flag. McKnight motioned us away from the door and rang
      the bell. There was no response, no sound within. He rang it twice, the
      last time long and vigorously, without result. Then he turned and looked
      at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't half like this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That woman is in; you heard me ask the
      elevator boy. For two cents I'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had seen it when he did. The door was ajar about an inch, and a narrow
      wedge of rose-colored light showed beyond. I pushed the door a little and
      listened. Then, with both men at my heels, I stepped into the private
      corridor of the apartment and looked around. It was a square reception
      hall, with rugs on the floor, a tall mahogany rack for hats, and a couple
      of chairs. A lantern of rose-colored glass and a desk light over a
      writing-table across made the room bright and cheerful. It was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of us was comfortable. The place was full of feminine trifles that
      made us feel the weakness of our position. Some such instinct made
      McKnight suggest division.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We look like an invading army,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If she's here alone, we will
      startle her into a spasm. One of us could take a look around and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that? Didn't you hear something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound, whatever it had been, was not repeated. We went awkwardly out
      into the hall, very uncomfortable, all of us, and flipped a coin. The
      choice fell to me, which was right enough, for the affair was mine,
      primarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait just inside the door,&rdquo; I directed, &ldquo;and if Sullivan comes, or
      anybody that answers his description, grab him without ceremony and ask
      him questions afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apartment, save in the hallway, was unlighted. By one of those freaks
      of arrangement possible only in the modern flat, I found the kitchen
      first, and was struck a smart and unexpected blow by a swinging door. I
      carried a handful of matches, and by the time I had passed through a
      butler's pantry and a refrigerator room I was completely lost in the
      darkness. Until then the situation had been merely uncomfortable; suddenly
      it became grisly. From somewhere near came a long-sustained groan,
      followed almost instantly by the crash of something&mdash;glass or china&mdash;on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck a fresh match, and found myself in a narrow rear hallway. Behind
      me was the door by which I must have come; with a keen desire to get back
      to the place I had started from, I opened the door and attempted to cross
      the room. I thought I had kept my sense of direction, but I crashed
      without warning into what, from the resulting jangle, was the
      dining-table, probably laid for dinner. I cursed my stupidity in getting
      into such a situation, and I cursed my nerves for making my hand shake
      when I tried to strike a match. The groan had not been repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I braced myself against the table and struck the match sharply against the
      sole of my shoe. It flickered faintly and went out. And then, without the
      slightest warning, another dish went off the table. It fell with a
      thousand splinterings; the very air seemed broken into crashing waves of
      sound. I stood still, braced against the table, holding the red end of the
      dying match, and listened. I had not long to wait; the groan came again,
      and I recognized it, the cry of a dog in straits. I breathed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, old fellow,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Come on, old man. Let's have a look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could hear the thud of his tail on the floor, but he did not move. He
      only whimpered. There is something companionable in the presence of a dog,
      and I fancied this dog in trouble. Slowly I began to work my way around
      the table toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; I said, as he whimpered. &ldquo;We'll find the light, which ought to
      be somewhere or other around here, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stumbled over something, and I drew back my foot almost instantly. &ldquo;Did
      I step on you, old man?&rdquo; I exclaimed, and bent to pat him. I remember
      straightening suddenly and hearing the dog pad softly toward me around the
      table. I recall even that I had put the matches down and could not find
      them. Then, with a bursting horror of the room and its contents, of the
      gibbering dark around me, I turned and made for the door by which I had
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not find it. I felt along the endless wainscoting, past miles of
      wall. The dog was beside me, I think, but he was part and parcel now, to
      my excited mind, with the Thing under the table. And when, after aeons of
      search, I found a knob and stumbled into the reception hall, I was as
      nearly in a panic as any man could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was myself again in a second, and by the light from the hall I led the
      way back to the tragedy I had stumbled on. Bronson still sat at the table,
      his elbows propped on it, his cigarette still lighted, burning a hole in
      the cloth. Partly under the table lay Mrs. Conway face down. The dog stood
      over her and wagged his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight pointed silently to a large copper ashtray, filled with ashes and
      charred bits of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notes, probably,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;He got them after all, and
      burned them before her. It was more than she could stand. Stabbed him
      first and then herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss got up and took off his hat. &ldquo;They are dead,&rdquo; he announced
      solemnly, and took his note-book out of his hatband.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight and I did the only thing we could think of&mdash;drove Hotchkiss
      and the dog out of the room, and closed and locked the door. &ldquo;It's a
      matter for the police,&rdquo; McKnight asserted. &ldquo;I suppose you've got an
      officer tied to you somewhere, Lawrence? You usually have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left Hotchkiss in charge and went down-stairs. It was McKnight who
      first saw Johnson, leaning against a park railing across the street, and
      called him over. We told him in a few words what we had found, and he
      grinned at me cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After while, in a few weeks or months, Mr. Blakeley,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you
      get tired of monkeying around with the blood-stain and finger-print
      specialist up-stairs, you come to me. I've had that fellow you want under
      surveillance for ten days!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXX. FINER DETAILS
    </h2>
    <p>
      At ten minutes before two the following day, Monday, I arrived at my
      office. I had spent the morning putting my affairs in shape, and in a trip
      to the stable. The afternoon would see me either a free man or a prisoner
      for an indefinite length of time, and, in spite of Johnson's promise to
      produce Sullivan, I was more prepared for the latter than the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blobs was watching for me outside the door, and it was clear that he was
      in a state of excitement bordering on delirium. He did nothing, however,
      save to tip me a wink that meant &ldquo;As man to man, I'm for you.&rdquo; I was too
      much engrossed either to reprove him or return the courtesy, but I heard
      him follow me down the hall to the small room where we keep outgrown
      lawbooks, typewriter supplies and, incidentally, our wraps. I was
      wondering vaguely if I would ever hang my hat on its nail again, when the
      door closed behind me. It shut firmly, without any particular amount of
      sound, and I was left in the dark. I groped my way to it, irritably, to
      find it locked on the outside. I shook it frantically, and was rewarded by
      a sibilant whisper through the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; Blobs was saying huskily. &ldquo;You're in deadly peril. The
      police are waiting in your office, three of 'em. I'm goin' to lock the
      whole bunch in and throw the key out of the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back here, you imp of Satan!&rdquo; I called furiously, but I could hear
      him speeding down the corridor, and the slam of the outer office door by
      which he always announced his presence. And so I stood there in that
      ridiculous cupboard, hot with the heat of a steaming September day, musty
      with the smell of old leather bindings, littered with broken overshoes and
      handleless umbrellas. I was apoplectic with rage one minute, and choked
      with laughter the next. It seemed an hour before Blobs came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came without haste, strutting with new dignity, and paused outside my
      prison door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess that will hold them for a while,&rdquo; he remarked comfortably,
      and proceeded to turn the key. &ldquo;I've got 'em fastened up like sardines in
      a can!&rdquo; he explained, working with the lock. &ldquo;Gee whiz! you'd ought to
      hear 'em!&rdquo; When he got his breath after the shaking I gave him, he began
      to splutter. &ldquo;How'd I know?&rdquo; he demanded sulkily. &ldquo;You nearly broke your
      neck gettin' away the other time. And I haven't got the old key. It's
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's it lost?&rdquo; I demanded, with another gesture toward his coat
      collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down the elevator shaft.&rdquo; There was a gleam of indignant satisfaction
      through his tears of rage and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, while he hunted the key in the debris at the bottom of the shaft,
      I quieted his prisoners with the assurance that the lock had slipped, and
      that they would be free as lords as soon as we could find the janitor with
      a pass-key. Stuart went down finally and discovered Blobs, with the key in
      his pocket, telling the engineer how he had tried to save me from arrest
      and failed. When Stuart came up he was almost cheerful, but Blobs did not
      appear again that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneous with the finding of the key came Hotchkiss, and we went in
      together. I shook hands with two men who, with Hotchkiss, made a not very
      animated group. The taller one, an oldish man, lean and hard, announced
      his errand at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Pittsburg warrant?&rdquo; I inquired, unlocking my cigar drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Allegheny County has assumed jurisdiction, the exact locality where
      the crime was committed being in doubt.&rdquo; He seemed to be the spokesman.
      The other, shorter and rotund, kept an amiable silence. &ldquo;We hope you will
      see the wisdom of waiving extradition,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It will save time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come, of course,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;The sooner the better. But I want you
      to give me an hour here, gentlemen. I think we can interest you. Have a
      cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lean man took a cigar; the rotund man took three, putting two in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the catch of that door?&rdquo; he inquired jovially. &ldquo;Any danger of
      it going off again?&rdquo; Really, considering the circumstances, they were
      remarkably cheerful. Hotchkiss, however, was not. He paced the floor
      uneasily, his hands under his coat-tails. The arrival of McKnight created
      a diversion; he carried a long package and a corkscrew, and shook hands
      with the police and opened the bottle with a single gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always want something to cheer on these occasions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where's
      the water, Blakeley? Everybody ready?&rdquo; Then in French he toasted the two
      detectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your eternal discomfiture,&rdquo; he said, bowing ceremoniously. &ldquo;May you go
      home and never come back! If you take Monsieur Blakeley with you, I hope
      you choke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lean man nodded gravely. &ldquo;Prosit,&rdquo; he said. But the fat one leaned
      back and laughed consumedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss finished a mental synopsis of his position, and put down his
      glass. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said pompously, &ldquo;within five minutes the man you
      want will be here, a murderer caught in a net of evidence so fine that a
      mosquito could not get through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detectives glanced at each other solemnly. Had they not in their
      possession a sealskin bag containing a wallet and a bit of gold chain,
      which, by putting the crime on me, would leave a gap big enough for
      Sullivan himself to crawl through?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you say your little speech before Johnson brings the other man,
      Lawrence?&rdquo; McKnight inquired. &ldquo;They won't believe you, but it will help
      them to understand what is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, of course,&rdquo; the lean man put in gravely, &ldquo;that what you
      say may be used against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the risk,&rdquo; I answered impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took some time to tell the story of my worse than useless trip to
      Pittsburg, and its sequel. They listened gravely, without interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hotchkiss here,&rdquo; I finished, &ldquo;believes that the man Sullivan, whom we
      are momentarily expecting, committed the crime. Mr. McKnight is inclined
      to implicate Mrs. Conway, who stabbed Bronson and then herself last night.
      As for myself, I am open to conviction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said the stout detective quizzically. And then Alison was
      announced. My impulse to go out and meet her was forestalled by the
      detectives, who rose when I did. McKnight, therefore, brought her in, and
      I met her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have put you to a great deal of trouble,&rdquo; I said contritely, when I saw
      her glance around the room. &ldquo;I wish I had not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only right that I should come,&rdquo; she replied, looking up at me. &ldquo;I
      am the unconscious cause of most of it, I am afraid. Mrs. Dallas is going
      to wait in the outer office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I presented Hotchkiss and the two detectives, who eyed her with interest.
      In her poise, her beauty, even in her gown, I fancy she represented a new
      type to them. They remained standing until she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought the necklace,&rdquo; she began, holding out a white-wrapped box,
      &ldquo;as you asked me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I passed it, unopened, to the detectives. &ldquo;The necklace from which was
      broken the fragment you found in the sealskin bag,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;Miss
      West found it on the floor of the car, near lower ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you find it?&rdquo; asked the lean detective, bending forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning, not long before the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not certain,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have seen one very much like it.&rdquo; Her
      tone was troubled. She glanced at me as if for help, but I was powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; The detective was watching her closely. At that moment there came
      an interruption. The door opened without ceremony, and Johnson ushered in
      a tall, blond man, a stranger to all of us: I glanced at Alison; she was
      pale, but composed and scornful. She met the new-comer's eyes full, and,
      caught unawares, he took a hasty backward step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Sullivan,&rdquo; McKnight beamed cordially. &ldquo;Have a cigar? I beg
      your pardon, Alison, do you mind this smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she said composedly. Sullivan had had a second to sound his
      bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no, thanks,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;If you will be good enough to explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's what you're to do,&rdquo; McKnight said cheerfully, pulling up a
      chair. &ldquo;You've got the most attentive audience you could ask. These two
      gentlemen are detectives from Pittsburg, and we are all curious to know
      the finer details of what happened on the car Ontario two weeks ago, the
      night your father-in-law was murdered.&rdquo; Sullivan gripped the arms of his
      chair. &ldquo;We are not prejudiced, either. The gentlemen from Pittsburg are
      betting on Mr. Blakeley, over there. Mr. Hotchkiss, the gentleman by the
      radiator, is ready to place ten to one odds on you. And some of us have
      still other theories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; Sullivan said slowly, &ldquo;I give you my word of honor that I did
      not kill Simon Harrington, and that I do not know who did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlededee!&rdquo; cried Hotchkiss, bustling forward. &ldquo;Why, I can tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
       But McKnight pushed him firmly into a chair and held him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to plead guilty to the larceny,&rdquo; Sullivan went on. &ldquo;I took Mr.
      Blakeley's clothes, I admit. If I can reimburse him in any way for the
      inconvenience-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout detective was listening with his mouth open. &ldquo;Do you mean to
      say,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;that you got into Mr. Blakeley's berth, as he
      contends, took his clothes and forged notes, and left the train before the
      wreck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notes, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave them to Bronson yesterday. Much good they did him!&rdquo; bitterly. We
      were all silent for a moment. The two detectives were adjusting themselves
      with difficulty to a new point of view; Sullivan was looking dejectedly at
      the floor, his hands hanging loose between his knees. I was watching
      Alison; from where I stood, behind her, I could almost touch the soft hair
      behind her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no intention of pressing any charge against you,&rdquo; I said with
      forced civility, for my hands were itching to get at him, &ldquo;if you will
      give us a clear account of what happened on the Ontario that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan raised his handsome, haggard head and looked around at me. &ldquo;I've
      seen you before, haven't I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Weren't you an uninvited guest at
      the Laurels a few days&mdash;or nights&mdash;ago? The cat, you remember,
      and the rug that slipped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; I said shortly. He glanced from me to Alison and quickly
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth can't hurt me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it's devilish unpleasant. Alison,
      you know all this. You would better go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His use of her name crazed me. I stepped in front of her and stood over
      him. &ldquo;You will not bring Miss West into the conversation,&rdquo; I threatened,
      &ldquo;and she will stay if she wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; he said with assumed indifference. Hotchkiss just then
      escaped from Richey's grasp and crossed the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever wear glasses?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo; Sullivan glanced with some contempt at mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd better begin by going back a little,&rdquo; he went on sullenly. &ldquo;I suppose
      you know I was married to Ida Harrington about five years ago. She was a
      good girl, and I thought a lot of her. But her father opposed the marriage&mdash;he'd
      never liked me, and he refused to make any sort of settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought, of course, that there would be money, and it was a bad day
      when I found out I'd made a mistake. My sister was wild with
      disappointment. We were pretty hard up, my sister and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was watching Alison. Her hands were tightly clasped in her lap, and she
      was staring out of the window at the cheerless roof below. She had set her
      lips a little, but that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, of course, that I'm not defending myself,&rdquo; went on the
      sullen voice. &ldquo;The day came when old Harrington put us both out of the
      house at the point of a revolver, and I threatened&mdash;I suppose you
      know that, too&mdash;I threatened to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister and I had hard times after that. We lived on the continent for
      a while. I was at Monte Carlo and she was in Italy. She met a young lady
      there, the granddaughter of a steel manufacturer and an heiress, and she
      sent for me. When I got to Rome the girl was gone. Last winter I was all
      in&mdash;social secretary to an Englishman, a wholesale grocer with a new
      title, but we had a row, and I came home. I went out to the Heaton boys'
      ranch in Wyoming, and met Bronson there. He lent me money, and I've been
      doing his dirty work ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan got up then and walked slowly forward and back as he talked, his
      eyes on the faded pattern of the office rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to live in hell,&rdquo; he said savagely, &ldquo;put yourself in another
      man's power. Bronson got into trouble, forging John Gilmore's name to
      those notes, and in some way he learned that a man was bringing the papers
      back to Washington on the Flier. He even learned the number of his berth,
      and the night before the wreck, just as I was boarding the train, I got a
      telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss stepped forward once more importantly. &ldquo;Which read, I think:
      'Man with papers in lower ten, car seven. Get them.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan looked at the little man with sulky blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something like that, anyhow. But it was a nasty business, and it
      made matters worse that he didn't care that a telegram which must pass
      through a half dozen hands was more or less incriminating to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, to add to the unpleasantness of my position, just after we boarded
      the train&mdash;I was accompanying my sister and this young lady, Miss
      West&mdash;a woman touched me on the sleeve, and I turned to face&mdash;my
      wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That took away my last bit of nerve. I told my sister, and you can
      understand she was in a bad way, too. We knew what it meant. Ida had heard
      that I was going&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and glanced uneasily at Alison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;It is too late to shield me. The time to have
      done that was when I was your guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, his eyes turned carefully away from my face, which
      must have presented certainly anything but a pleasant sight. &ldquo;Miss West
      was going to do me the honor to marry me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; I burst forth, thrusting past Alison West's chair. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
      infernal cur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the detectives got up and stood between us. &ldquo;You must remember, Mr.
      Blakeley, that you are forcing this story from this man. These details are
      unpleasant, but important. You were going to marry this young lady,&rdquo; he
      said, turning to Sullivan, &ldquo;although you already had a wife living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my sister's plan, and I was in a bad way for money. If I could
      marry, secretly, a wealthy girl and go to Europe, it was unlikely that Ida&mdash;that
      is, Mrs. Sullivan&mdash;would hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was more than a shock to see my wife on the train, and to realize
      from her face that she knew what was going on. I don't know yet, unless
      some of the servants&mdash;well, never mind that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It meant that the whole thing had gone up. Old Harrington had carried a
      gun for me for years, and the same train wouldn't hold both of us. Of
      course, I thought that he was in the coach just behind ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss was leaning forward now, his eyes narrowed, his thin lips drawn
      to a line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you left-handed, Mr. Sullivan?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan stopped in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;Can't do anything with my left hand.&rdquo; Hotchkiss
      subsided, crestfallen but alert. &ldquo;I tore up that cursed telegram, but I
      was afraid to throw the scraps away. Then I looked around for lower ten.
      It was almost exactly across&mdash;my berth was lower seven, and it was,
      of course, a bit of exceptional luck for me that the car was number
      seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell your sister of the telegram from Bronson?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It would do no good, and she was in a bad way without that to make
      her worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister was killed, think.&rdquo; The shorter detective took a small
      package from his pocket and held it in his hand, snapping the rubber band
      which held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she was killed,&rdquo; Sullivan said soberly. &ldquo;What I say now can do her
      no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to push back the heavy hair which dropped over his forehead,
      and went on more connectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was late, after midnight, and we went at once to our berths. I
      undressed, and then I lay there for an hour, wondering how I was going to
      get the notes. Some one in lower nine was restless and wide awake, but
      finally became quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man in ten was sleeping heavily. I could hear his breathing, and it
      seemed to be only a question of getting across and behind the curtains of
      his berth without being seen. After that, it was a mere matter of quiet
      searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The car became very still. I was about to try for the other berth, when
      some one brushed softly past, and I lay back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, however, when things had been quiet for a time, I got up, and
      after looking along the aisle, I slipped behind the curtains of lower ten.
      You understand, Mr. Blakeley, that I thought you were in lower ten, with
      the notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not trying to defend myself,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I was ready to steal the
      notes&mdash;I had to. But murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I slipped across and behind the curtains. It was very still. The
      man in ten didn't move, although my heart was thumping until I thought he
      would hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt around cautiously. It was perfectly dark, and I came across a bit
      of chain, about as long as my finger. It seemed a queer thing to find
      there, and it was sticky, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered, and I could see Alison's hands clenching and unclenching
      with the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All at once it struck me that the man was strangely silent, and I think I
      lost my nerve. Anyhow, I drew the curtains open a little, and let the
      light fall on my hands. They were red, blood-red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned one hand on the back of the chair, and was silent for a moment,
      as though he lived over again the awful events of that more than awful
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout detective had let his cigar go out; he was still drawing at it
      nervously. Richey had picked up a paper-weight and was tossing it from
      hand to hand; when it slipped and fell to the floor, a startled shudder
      passed through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something glittering in there,&rdquo; Sullivan resumed, &ldquo;and on
      impulse I picked it up. Then I dropped the curtains and stumbled back to
      my own berth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you wiped your hands on the bed-clothing and stuck the dirk into
      the pillow.&rdquo; Hotchkiss was seeing his carefully built structure crumbling
      to pieces, and he looked chagrined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I did&mdash;I'm not very clear about what happened then. But
      when I rallied a little I saw a Russia leather wallet lying in the aisle
      almost at my feet, and, like a fool, I stuck it, with the bit of chain,
      into my bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sat there, shivering, for what seemed hours. It was still perfectly
      quiet, except for some one snoring. I thought that would drive me crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more I thought of it the worse things looked. The telegram was the
      first thing against me&mdash;it would put the police on my track at once,
      when it was discovered that the man in lower ten had been killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I remembered the notes, and I took out the wallet and opened it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for a minute, as if the recalling of the next occurrence was
      almost beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took out the wallet,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;and opening it, held it to the
      light. In gilt letters was the name, Simon Harrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detectives were leaning forward now, their eyes on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things seemed to whirl around for a while. I sat there almost paralyzed,
      wondering what this new development meant for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, I knew, would swear I had killed her father; nobody would be
      likely to believe the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe me now?&rdquo; He rooked around at us defiantly. &ldquo;I am telling
      the absolute truth, and not one of you believes me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a bit the man in lower nine got up and walked along the aisle
      toward the smoking compartment. I heard him go, and, leaning from my
      berth, watched him out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then I got the idea of changing berths with him, getting into his
      clothes, and leaving the train. I give you my word I had no idea of
      throwing suspicion on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alison looked scornfully incredulous, but I felt that the man was telling
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I changed the numbers of the berths, and it worked well. I got into the
      other man's berth, and he came back to mine. The rest was easy. I dressed
      in his clothes&mdash;luckily, they fitted&mdash;and jumped the train not
      far from Baltimore, just before the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something else you must clear up,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why did you try to
      telephone me from M-, and why did you change your mind about the message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew I was at M-?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we traced you. What about the message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was this way: of course, I did not know your name, Mr. Blakeley.
      The telegram said, 'Man with papers in lower ten, car seven,&rdquo; and after I
      had made what I considered my escape, I began to think I had left the man
      in my berth in a bad way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would probably be accused of the crime. So, although when the wreck
      occurred I supposed every one connected with the affair had been killed,
      there was a chance that you had survived. I've not been of much account,
      but I didn't want a man to swing because I'd left him in my place.
      Besides, I began to have a theory of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we entered the car a tall, dark woman passed us, with a glass of water
      in her hand, and I vaguely remembered her. She was amazingly like Blanche
      Conway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she, too, thought the man with the notes was in lower ten, it
      explained a lot, including that piece of a woman's necklace. She was a
      fury, Blanche Conway, capable of anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you countermand that message?&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got to the Carter house, and got to bed&mdash;I had sprained my
      ankle in the jump&mdash;I went through the alligator bag I had taken from
      lower nine. When I found your name, I sent the first message. Then, soon
      after, I came across the notes. It seemed too good to be true, and I was
      crazy for fear the message had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first I was going to send them to Bronson; then I began to see what
      the possession of the notes meant to me. It meant power over Bronson,
      money, influence, everything. He was a devil, that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's at home now,&rdquo; said McKnight, and we were glad to laugh and
      relieve the tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alison put her hand over her eyes, as if to shut out the sight of the man
      she had so nearly married, and I furtively touched one of the soft little
      curls that nestled at the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was able to walk,&rdquo; went on the sullen voice, &ldquo;I came at once to
      Washington. I tried to sell the notes to Bronson, but he was almost at the
      end of his rope. Not even my threat to send them back to you, Mr.
      Blakeley, could make him meet my figure. He didn't have the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKnight was triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you gentlemen will see reason in my theory now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Conway wanted the notes to force a legal marriage, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective with the small package carefully rolled off the rubber band,
      and unwrapped it. I held my breath as he took out, first, the Russia
      leather wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things, Mr. Blakeley, we found in the seal-skin bag Mr. Sullivan
      says he left you. This wallet, Mr. Sullivan&mdash;is this the one you
      found on the floor of the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan opened it, and, glancing at the name inside, &ldquo;Simon Harrington,&rdquo;
       nodded affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; went on the detective&mdash;&ldquo;this is a piece of gold chain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be,&rdquo; said Sullivan, recoiling at the blood-stained end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, I believe, is the dagger.&rdquo; He held it up, and Alison gave a faint
      cry of astonishment and dismay. Sullivan's face grew ghastly, and he sat
      down weakly on the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective looked at him shrewdly, then at Alison's agitated face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you seen this dagger before, young lady?&rdquo; he asked, kindly
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't ask me!&rdquo; she gasped breathlessly, her eyes turned on Sullivan.
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's too terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; I advised, leaning over to her. &ldquo;It will be found out later,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; she said, nodding toward Sullivan. The detective unwrapped the
      small box Alison had brought, disclosing the trampled necklace and broken
      chain. With clumsy fingers he spread it on the table and fitted into place
      the bit of chain. There could be no doubt that it belonged there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you find that chain?&rdquo; Sullivan asked hoarsely, looking for the
      first time at Alison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the floor, near the murdered man's berth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Sullivan,&rdquo; said the detective civilly, &ldquo;I believe you can tell
      us, in the light of these two exhibits, who really did murder Simon
      Harrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan looked again at the dagger, a sharp little bit of steel with a
      Florentine handle. Then he picked up the locket and pressed a hidden
      spring under one of the cameos. Inside, very neatly engraved, was the name
      and a date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, his face ghastly, &ldquo;it is of no use for me to attempt
      a denial. The dagger and necklace belonged to my sister, Alice Curtis!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. AND ONLY ONE ARM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss was the first to break the tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sullivan,&rdquo; he asked suddenly, &ldquo;was your sister left-handed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotchkiss put away his note-book and looked around with an air of
      triumphant vindication. It gave us a chance to smile and look relieved.
      After all, Mrs. Curtis was dead. It was the happiest solution of the
      unhappy affair. McKnight brought Sullivan some whisky, and he braced up a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learned through the papers that my wife was in a Baltimore hospital,
      and yesterday I ventured there to see her. I felt if she would help me to
      keep straight, that now, with her father and my sister both dead, we might
      be happy together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand now what puzzled me then. It seemed that my sister went into
      the next car and tried to make my wife promise not to interfere. But Ida&mdash;Mrs.
      Sullivan&mdash;was firm, of course. She said her father had papers,
      certificates and so on, that would stop the marriage at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said, also, that her father was in our car, and that there would be
      the mischief to pay in the morning. It was probably when my sister tried
      to get the papers that he awakened, and she had to do&mdash;what she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was over. Save for a technicality or two, I was a free man. Alison rose
      quietly and prepared to go; the men stood to let her pass, save Sullivan
      who sat crouched in his chair, his face buried in his hands. Hotchkiss,
      who had been tapping the desk with his pencil, looked up abruptly and
      pointed the pencil at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all this is true, and I believe it is,&mdash;then who was in the house
      next door, Blakeley, the night you and Mr. Johnson searched? You remember,
      you said it was a woman's hand at the trap door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced hastily at Johnson, whose face was impassive. He had his hand on
      the knob of the door and he opened it before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were a number of scratches on Mrs. Conway's right hand,&rdquo; he
      observed to the room in general. &ldquo;Her wrist was bandaged and badly
      bruised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out then, but he turned as he closed the door and threw at me a
      glance of half-amused, half-contemptuous tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKnight saw Alison, with Mrs. Dallas, to their carriage, and came back
      again. The gathering in the office was breaking up. Sullivan, looking worn
      and old, was standing by the window, staring at the broken necklace in his
      hand. When he saw me watching him, he put it on the desk and picked up his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can not do anything more&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have done about enough,&rdquo; I replied grimly, and he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that Richey and Hotchkiss led me somewhere to dinner, and that,
      for fear I would be lonely without him, they sent for Johnson. And I
      recall a spirited discussion in which Hotchkiss told the detective that he
      could manage certain cases, but that he lacked induction. Richey and I
      were mainly silent. My thoughts would slip ahead to that hour, later in
      the evening, when I should see Alison again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed in savage haste finally, and was so particular about my tie that
      Mrs. Klopton gave up in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, until your arm is better, that you would buy the kind that hooks
      on,&rdquo; she protested, almost tearfully. &ldquo;I'm sure they look very nice, Mr.
      Lawrence. My late husband always&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a lover's knot you've tied this time,&rdquo; I snarled, and, jerking
      open the bow knot she had so painfully executed, looked out the window for
      Johnson&mdash;until I recalled that he no longer belonged in my
      perspective. I ended by driving frantically to the club and getting George
      to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was late, of course. The drawing-room and library at the Dallas home
      were empty. I could hear billiard balls rolling somewhere, and I turned
      the other way. I found Alison at last on the balcony, sitting much as she
      had that night on the beach,&mdash;her chin in her hands, her eyes fixed
      unseeingly on the trees and lights of the square across. She was even
      whistling a little, softly. But this time the plaintiveness was gone. It
      was a tender little tune. She did not move, as I stood beside her, looking
      down. And now, when the moment had come, all the thousand and one things I
      had been waiting to say forsook me, precipitately beat a retreat, and left
      me unsupported. The arc-moon sent little fugitive lights over her hair,
      her eyes, her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't&mdash;do that,&rdquo; I said unsteadily. &ldquo;You&mdash;you know what I want
      to do when you whistle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at me, and she did not stop. She did not stop! She went on
      whistling softly, a bit tremulously. And straightway I forgot the street,
      the chance of passers-by, the voices in the house behind us. &ldquo;The world
      doesn't hold any one but you,&rdquo; I said reverently. &ldquo;It is our world,
      sweetheart. I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy was whistling on the pavement below. I let her go reluctantly and
      sat back where I could see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't done this the way I intended to at all,&rdquo; I confessed. &ldquo;In books
      they get things all settled, and then kiss the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settled?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, about getting married and that sort of thing,&rdquo; I explained with
      elaborate carelessness. &ldquo;We&mdash;we could go down to Bermuda&mdash;or&mdash;or
      Jamaica, say in December.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand away and faced me squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are afraid!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I refuse to marry you unless
      you propose properly. Everybody does it. And it is a woman's privilege:
      she wants to have that to look back to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I consented with an exaggerated sigh. &ldquo;If you will promise
      not to think I look like an idiot, I shall do it, knee and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to pass her to close the door behind us, but when I kissed her again
      she protested that we were not really engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to look down at her. &ldquo;It is a terrible thing,&rdquo; I said exultantly,
      &ldquo;to love a girl the way I love you, and to have only one arm!&rdquo; Then I
      closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      From across the street there came a sharp crescendo whistle, and a vaguely
      familiar figure separated itself from the park railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he called, in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;shall I throw the key down the
      elevator shaft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
